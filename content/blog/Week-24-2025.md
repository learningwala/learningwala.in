#### 9th June to 15th June 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

This will be a short note. Nothing much happened this week.

We celebrated International Play Day at the office, and it was super fun! The office team asked our relatives for our childhood photos and made a beautiful collage. It was really, really enjoyable to recognize each other from childhood photographs. We played games and shared our childhood memories.

One of our close friends came to spend time with us at our place. I feel very wholesome when someone comes to spend time with us without any specific agenda—cooking together, eating together, talking, sharing ideas, taking a walk together. That gives me warmth and makes me feel loved.

Nowadays, I'm realizing that spending time with friends, family, and loved ones is what's truly interesting. I should do it more. One part of myself always leans towards interesting projects, but now I want to consciously choose the projects and people I work with, as well as my working patterns. I want to invest my time and energy in spending time and having interesting experiences with loved ones.

I'm also wondering why people aspire for job stability or working long-term in one organization. It's because it gives you security and belonging—you get time and mental space to think about other things in life. When you stay at one organization and remain in one place (city or town), you make connections with that city. It would be wonderful to have friends nearby. Living close to your dear friends is a bliss.

Still, I don't feel connected to Ahmedabad. I felt connected to Vadodara, Bhuj, and Bangalore. I need to make more effort.

I'm feeling very grateful to the universe. We're both getting very nice work opportunities. I'm working with organizations and projects, directly or indirectly, that I'm really aligned with. Sometimes it's overwhelming to work on too many projects, and I get anxiety, but it's okay. I'm learning to manage it.

We started an online yoga class, but it's not working well. In a week, we only did it for two days. It's not a live class—they're doing YouTube live with interactive chat. Let's see how it goes. I wish to start some legitimate sports activity like cycling, swimming, or running.

We're now regular with breakfast, making very simple things like ragi malt with milk and dry fruits, or oats.

I bought Kesar mangoes from our office's mango orchard. They are so yummy! We made aam ras and loved it.
