#### 15th to 20th Sep 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

Ah, the day is over... the week is over as well. In a few days the month will be over, and in a few months the year will be over. This week was an emotional roller coaster. I am not feeling centered; I am feeling like I am scattered everywhere. I need an anchor.

Maybe I will start writing morning and evening pages again to gain stability.

Monday was a regular office day. The chaos is still going on. These days I am getting more irritated and angry about small things. The overall transition is giving me anxiety.

Tuesday - It was Nidhi's birthday. We celebrated very simply. I took help from a colleague at the office to send her favorite ras malai during lunch time. In the evening, Tannu sent cake, flowers, and some other interesting gifts. We did a video call with Nidhi's family and friends and cut the cake.

For dinner we wanted something simple. I remembered that Nidhi likes the food from 'Jassi de Parathe', so we decided to go there. There was a 30-minute wait at that restaurant. I thought on weekdays it would be easy to get space, but that wasn't the reality. We went to another paratha place called 'Aunty de Parathe', ordered some aloo palak paratha and paneer paratha which came out really spicy, which we could not eat. So we just packed that food and went to our comfort place called Padmanabham Cafe to eat idli dosa. I took plain dosa and Nidhi took normal steam idli. We like the sambhar and chutney of this place. That's it - simple dinner and lots of hugs. Happy closing of the day.

Tuesday - we started our first session with children. Nidhi and I prepared and gave nice postcards for our office pilot project team.

Tuesday to Friday went well, busy and filled with the presence of children. They are an energy source for me.

Friday - teammates from the pilot team made a small brochure about the sessions we did with children this week. I was super happy to see that. They printed it on nice off-white paper.

#### Updates

I am not able to follow my diet properly. I got cravings... Cravings to eat dosa, nice sambhar, dahi vada... never felt cravings before this. But these days my food options are very limited - turai, lauki, karela, beans sabji, moong dal, roti... that's it. No mirchi, no masala.

I like the simple food, but sometimes in the evening I get cravings, during snack time. But it's okay, I will manage this week. Dosa is not that harmful.

Yoga is off from the last few days because of my work schedule. I need to reach the office by 9am, so I need to leave by 8:30am. I need to wake up by 7am regularly so I can do yoga in the 7:30am batch and finish other things quickly before 8:30am. But I will need help to make breakfast in the morning. Let's see how it goes.

I was reflecting... In Panchkosha theory (Indian Philosophy), there is Annamaya Kosha which contains - Aahar, Nidra, and Vyayam. Food, Sleep, and Exercise. This is the most essential thing to function, which is what I am focusing on these days.

Saturday & Sunday:

Again this Saturday I was super duper tired, back pain was at its peak. I was blaming my Activa and driving for that, but I realized that my mattress is a box-type mattress and it is not flexible enough to give appropriate back support. Thank god we recently bought a cotton mattress and immediately I changed it. Now it is good. Let's see how it goes.

This morning I made a long task list but couldn't complete anything, except writing this weekly note.

What else?

Some existential crises are going on... What work am I doing, why am I doing it... What will be the future... All those types of thoughts. Right now I am reminding myself to just stay and work with children regularly.

Today I tried to make a postcard with photos of inspirations from the education field. That gives me hope and positive energy. Jane Sahi, David Horsburgh, Srivi Kalyan... These people are examples of philosophy and practice all together. Vidya = knowing and doing together.

Home stuff is going okay, not very well.

---

I am looking forward to a new week filled with new energy and wonderful sessions with children.

Need to work on my emotions. Need to be calm, more mindful... This week I got upset because of small things. This is all because of background things happening at home, at work... Stress... Slowly I will work on it.

Overall good week... I am in a much better space after writing all this.
