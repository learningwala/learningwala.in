## Version 1 - simple :

Our true nature is a state of inner joy, peace, clarity, and connection — where we feel light, open, and deeply at home in ourselves and with the world. A person living from this true nature acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, we are not able to live in this space every moment because our mind gets clouded by avidyā — ignorance of who we really are — which shows up as old habits, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that cover our inner light. Vidyā, or true knowledge, is the process of clearing these clouds so the sun of our real self can shine naturally. To do this, we walk paths that engage the whole being through the Panchakosha framework: yoga practices to align body, breath, and mind; the 64 kalās to refine our senses, skills, and creativity; and Rasa theory to understand and harmonize our emotions. Together, these tools help children and adults alike live more and more from their true nature, moment to moment.

## Version 2 :

Our Ātman — the innermost Self — is identical with Brahman, the infinite reality. In its pure state, it is sat–chit–ānanda: existence, consciousness, and bliss. Living in awareness of this Self feels like natural joy, peace, clarity, and connection — a sense of being fully at home in oneself and in harmony with the universe. One who abides in this realization acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life from presence rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, this abiding awareness is often veiled by avidyā — ignorance of our true identity as Ātman–Brahman — manifesting as old patterns, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that obscure our inner light. Vidyā, or liberating knowledge, is the process of removing these coverings so the radiance of the Self shines unobstructed.

For children aged 3–8, education can nurture this natural awareness by protecting their curiosity, guiding their emotions, and helping them explore the world with wonder rather than fear. Through the Panchakosha framework, yoga can help them develop body–mind awareness and calm breathing; the 64 kalās can be introduced as age-appropriate creative arts and life skills to refine senses and expression; and Rasa theory can guide activities that help them recognize, name, and balance emotions. In this way, early learning does not just transfer information but cultivates a child’s wholeness — allowing them to grow without losing touch with their true Self, so that the seed of Ātman–Brahman awareness can flourish throughout life.
