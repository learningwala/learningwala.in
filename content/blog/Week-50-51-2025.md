### 8th to 14th Dec (Monday to Sunday) , 15th to 21st Dec 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

This time also I couldn't make time for writing weekly notes. It is ok. I am happy that life is overpowering. But I need some break now—too many things are happening. Maybe the coming Christmas week will be a little slow and calm. But you never know...

Nothing much happened in the first week—mostly office work, sessions with children. On Saturday we went to naturopathy with Mummy. Sunday we went to our new rented place, did a basic pooja, and came back. 

Sunday evening we went to attend a workshop by Prerna. She is doing really nice work. Mummy also joined us for the workshop, she enjoyed it.

**Second week**

Mon to Friday - office work.
This week we went to naturopathy with Mummy two times. We did blood tests also. Let's see how this treatment goes.

Friday, Nidhi went for a sleepover night at her workplace. She enjoyed it. They made nice khichdi-kadhi and played games.

Saturday we did packing in the morning, and in the evening I went to attend a balgeet program at [Shining Spiral](https://shiningspiral.org/) (Waldorf-inspired micro school in Ahmedabad). I was happy to see Bhargav Purohit, Dhavanit, and other interesting people collaborating and working with children, language, and education at large.

Sunday we did packing, booked a tempo from the Porter app, and moved all our stuff to the new place. It is a super tiring process.

Even after taking a furnished home, this time we need to buy some basic stuff like a water purifier, geyser, and most important thing—AC. Yes, we took this offer because of a big balcony and open space where we can put plants and all... I am not sure it is a good decision or not because summers are on the way and we will not be able to sit in the balcony at all... but it is ok. We have a cooler with us, and we can buy a second-hand AC in the off-season so we'll get a discount. The area is good, the house is pretty... house owner's interference is there, but ok, we will manage.

This is an impulsive decision we took because we didn't have time for going and looking at different houses. It is ok, we will survive one year somehow, and if needed we will find another house. Bed, washing machine, fridge, and other stuff is there.

Anyway, finance-wise—emotion-wise, this time is difficult.

Work-wise this period is tough. How to go forward?

Nidhi's home situation is also bad. Dadaji's health is not well, Father's health is not well. She is visiting Kanpur from 23rd to 1st.

Anyway... this will also pass... I have hope...

I have applied for [Samagata](https://samagata.org/) grants to start an open children's library in Ahmadabad. I am very, very hopeful about this.
