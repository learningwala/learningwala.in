## 6th Oct to 11th Oct 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

### Monday - Friday

This week was heavy lifting at the office. Our whole team was preparing for a drama performance for children aged 6 to 8 years. We're going to perform it on 14th October 2025. The play is based on a Gujarati story written by Gijubhai.

Throughout this week, we took regular sessions with children and also did rehearsals for the play. It was tiring for me. I realized that I am 30 years old now.

### Friday - Karva Chauth

We celebrated Karva Chauth. As a Gujarati, this is a new festival for me. It was the first time for Nidhiâ€”she had seen her mother and dadi doing it. She was super excited to celebrate it. I brought all the required materials. We wore new clothes and went to the terrace, worshipped the moon, took photos, and came back. Surprisingly, many people in our building were celebrating this festival on the roof.

**Morning**

We went for a tree walk session at a nearby garden.

**Afternoon**

Nidhi did her packing and left for Kanpur by train. I stayed back because I need to perform the play for the children on 14th.

We had booked our train tickets 3 months ago. At that time, there was no plan to do the play. I canceled my train trip and booked an expensive flight ticket instead. But it's okay, I'm too excited for the play we are going to perform.

**Evening**

I went to see a very interesting Gujarati play called **Gamti Vaat**. It was long overdue to see this play.

Coincidentally, it was a free show as part of Ahmedabad Cultural Week. It had a really interesting performance style where there is only one actor who invites people from the audience to act short parts in the play on the spot.

They also give some chits to the audience and ask them to speak when a particular part comes up in the play. Like this, they make you part of the play... part of the creation. I really liked the idea.

I also liked the Gujarati sugam sangeet playlist they were playing.

I discovered that Shyamal-Saumil has composed many songs based on Ramesh Parekh's poetry.
