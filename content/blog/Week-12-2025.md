#### 16th to 22nd March 2025 (Sunday to Saturday)
It was a roller coaster week, the end part of the week was emotionally demanding.
- My parents went back to Padra on Sunday. I am living in Thaltej and my parents needed to catch the bus from Geeta Mandir bus stop which is 13km away from here. I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus & local train routes. I was remembering the map man - [Arun Ganesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Planemad)
- Managing wet waste, especially managing food waste is difficult in city/flat/apartment living. Doing composting when there's no balcony in your flat is difficult. It's also time consuming when both of us are working. What are some techniques I can implement? At my home in Padra we used to give food waste to dogs or cows on the street.
- Aadhvan pointed out that my blog's RSS feed wasn't working. Images weren't loading in the RSS reader because the base URL was 'localhost:1313' instead of 'learningwala.in'. I figured that I was using the 'hugo server' command to build the live site, which makes the base URL localhost. I changed my workflow. Now I'm using:
```
hugo --baseURL "https://learningwala.in/" --cleanDestinationDir
python3 -m http.server
```
It worked out.
- Again, I tried making markdown files from my accounts on Medium.com. I wanted to move all my old blog posts from Medium to my current Hugo site. I used Pandoc to convert HTML to markdown, downloaded all the images, added metadata, and changed image paths with the help of a Python script. Finally, I tried putting all the files in the Hugo folder. Some errors are coming up because of Medium's HTML elements. Now I'm frustrated with this. I'll slowly just copy-paste all the posts in markdown. That will be better.
- Went for a dinner at [Aarambh Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/cafeaarambh/?hl=en) on sunday evening. Met Bansari.We need to plan meetings with Nidhi, Bansari, Vishnu, and one more with our office team.
- At the office, it was a hectic week, mostly meetings & presentations. We celebrated 'World Storytelling Day' on 20th March. All the teammates made impromptu stories and acted out short skits.
- Nidhi came back from Kanpur on Thursday. We went to Kamla cafe for dinner. Dadaji is back home from the hospital and on medication.

- Now for the sad part of the week. There are extreme family conflicts going on. One more big reminder for me that patriarchy is real. It is very emotionally demanding and a test of life skills. I'm grateful that Nidhi and my close friends are with me in this difficult situation. I went to Padra on Friday, and brought mummy with me to ahemdabad. Spent Saturday with Nidhi and mummy.

### What else?

- Next month I need to visit Bhopal for a Child Development Course. Need to plan things for the same.
- Some more short projects are coming up apart from office work. Need to respond to that.
- Need to kick start the work of 'Khojbeen Mandali'
- Need to plan camp for Sakha fellows

overall mood is ok, sad - angry - frustrated - hopeful - at the moment I am ok. Thanks to Nidhi & mummy. 

**Reading:** Still reading Electric Train. Nidhi was telling today that she will continue her 'Banaras book'. I might buy one or two books from Navjeevan on Sunday. I need some variety in reading, but still first preference is 'Lalit Nibandh' - essays and second preference is short stories or poems :)

**I am looking forward to this :**
