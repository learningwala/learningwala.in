### 2nd to 8th Feb 2026 (Mon to Sunday)

**Mon to Fri** - Mostly office work. I did some tasks related to the children's lit project whenever I got a chance.

**Wed** - I had a meeting with B about the children's lit project. Slowly it is taking shape. We found someone for designing and layout who can be part of the core team.

**Fri** - We got the grant money in the account. Now we can collaborate with different people with more confidence.

**Sat & Sun** - Spent time working on the child lit project. On Sunday the child lit team had a meeting.

Nidhi and I finished one year together in marriage. 8th Feb Sunday, today is our anniversary. We went to Gidima South Indian restaurant for dinner. Nothing fancy, no gifts, nothing. Simple dinner and spending time together. We had very bad memories attached to our marriage day so we need to slowly work on telling a new story about the day.

On 26th Feb one of our close friends' marriages is coming up. The three of us will try to go to Bhopal for the same.

Slowly things are coming into place.
