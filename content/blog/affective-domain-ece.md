A group of children sits in a circle.

I show them a picture of a man cutting a tree.

I ask a simple question:  
**"How do you feel when you look at this picture?"**

Hands go up.

One child says,

> "I don't like it. We should not cut trees. Trees give us oxygen."

Another adds,

> "It is nice. We can make a table from the wood."

A third says thoughtfully,

> "If we cut a big tree, we can get fruits easily from the top."

Later, I show another picture—a man killing an ant by stepping on it.

Responses come quickly:

* "It is bad. There is God inside the ant. We will be punished."
* "It is okay to kill the ant because I feel scared of ants."

### **The Educator's Dilemma**

As educators, moments like these often leave us uncertain.

Do we correct them?  
Do we explain what is right and wrong?  
Do we guide them toward "environmental values"?

Or… is something else needed here?

## Is it possible to work with the affective domain at this age?

**Yes**—but only if we understand **how children think and feel between 3–6 years**.

To do this well, two frameworks are especially helpful:

* **Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development**
* **Bloom's affective domain**

---

## What Piaget Helps Us See

According to **Jean Piaget**, children aged 3–6 are in the **preoperational stage**.

At this stage, children:

* Think **concretely**, not abstractly
* Learn through **images, stories, and symbols**
* Often repeat **adult language** without deep understanding
* Experience the world primarily through **their own feelings**

So when children say:

* "Trees give oxygen"
* "God will punish us"

Piaget would not see this as ethical reasoning.

Instead, this is **symbolic imitation**—children borrowing words they have heard, not concepts they have reasoned through.

### What Piaget Does *Not* Say

Piaget does *not* say children cannot feel empathy or care.

He only reminds us that:

* Logical moral reasoning is not yet possible
* Abstract explanations will not land meaningfully

**This is crucial.**

At this age:

* **Ethics cannot be taught**
* **Affective experience is fully alive**

So if we stop trying to *teach values* and instead focus on *felt experience*, we are working developmentally correctly.

## Bloom and the Affective Domain

Bloom's taxonomy is often used only for thinking skills, but Bloom also articulated a clear **affective domain**—which is central in early childhood.

### Bloom's Affective Levels (Simplified)

For young children, the first three levels matter most:

**1. Receiving** – noticing, paying attention  
   *("I see a tree being cut")*

**2. Responding** – emotional reaction  
   *("I don't like it", "I feel scared")*

**3. Valuing (emerging)** – showing preference or care  
   *("We should walk carefully", "I like trees")*

Higher levels—organizing values or forming ethical systems—belong to later childhood and adolescence.

So when children express fear, care, usefulness, or punishment, they are operating exactly where Bloom says they should be.

## A Key Shift for Educators

### From Judgment to Noticing

Instead of asking:

* "Is this right or wrong?"
* "Should we do this or not?"

We ask:

* "What do you notice is happening?"
* "What do you think the tree or ant might be experiencing?"
* "What happens inside your body when you see this?"

This moves children away from borrowed morality and toward **direct affective experience**.

---

## How to Work with Such Moments
### A Simple Process

### **1. Hold All Responses Without Correction**

Fear, care, usefulness, punishment—*all are real experiences*.

Instead of correcting, mirror:

* "You're feeling scared."
* "You're thinking about using the tree."
* "You're worried about punishment."

This creates **affective safety**.

---

### **2. Use Imagination to Deepen Empathy**

Young children enter the affective domain through **imagination**.

**With the tree:**

* "If the tree could talk, what might it say?"
* "Who else lives on this tree?"

**With the ant:**

* "Where was the ant going?"
* "Does it live alone or with others?"

There are no right answers. Silence is welcome.

---

### **3. Let Contradictions Coexist**

Some children feel fear.  
Some feel care.  
Some think about human needs.

Instead of resolving this, name it:

> "Different feelings are present here.  
> More than one feeling can exist at the same time."

This itself is deep affective learning.

---

### **4. Be Careful with Abstractions**

Concepts like:

* oxygen
* God
* punishment

...often bypass lived experience.

Bring children back to the **sensory and relational**:

* "How does it feel to sit under a tree?"
* "How would it feel if someone stepped on you?"

**Ethics grows from experience, not instruction.**

---

### **5. Close with Small Care-Actions**

Not moral conclusions.

* Walking carefully and watching the ground
* Touching a tree gently
* Observing ants without disturbing them

This completes the affective loop:

**feeling → relationship → action**

---

## What This Work Is—and What It Is Not

### This is **NOT** about:

* Teaching environmental morality
* Fixing children's answers
* Forming values too early

### This **IS** about:

* Protecting the child's capacity to feel
* Allowing empathy to arise naturally
* Laying the ground for later ethical understanding

---

## In Essence

**Piaget** reminds us of the **limits of thinking** in early childhood.  
**Bloom** reminds us of the **power of feeling**.

Environmental consciousness in early childhood does not begin with rules or explanations.

It begins with **attention, imagination, fear, care, and relationship**.
