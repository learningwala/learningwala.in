#### 5th May to 11th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

It was my birthday week. I never celebrated birthdays explicitly in my childhood or even in my adulthood - no cake cutting, no party. In school, May 9th was mostly vacation time. In adulthood, I worked in schools, so again I had vacation during that time. At home, mom used to make my favorite food 'vedhmi' / puran poli. I never got a chance to celebrate my birthday with friends. I remember celebrating once with my Eklavya office colleagues, friends, and participants.

But this time was different. Nidhi and friends made it super special.

Apart from that, this week was full of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness because of the political situation in the country and the situation at my home. I messaged my friends in Bhuj to check on them during blackout days. Got news about the ceasefire and very soon after, the breaking of that ceasefire.

At home, also ceasefire happened; we involved some other family members too. Mom went to Padra on Sunday. Let's see how long this ceasefire lasts...

**Monday** was a regular office day. There was a storm in the evening. It was raining at night. Nidhi made wonderful cold coffee in the evening.

**Tuesday** I worked from home. My stomach was not well.

**Wednesday** I also worked from home because of rain. We went to Teapost, Sindhu Bhavan Road in the evening.

We received the [Nagarathna Memorial Grant](https://thejeshgn.com/2025/05/07/nagarathna-memorial-grant-2025-results/). We will use the grant money for the local khoji camp coming up at the end of May.

**On Thursday**, we set up paintings. Now this home feels like home.

**On Saturday**, we went to Gandhi Ashram. I visited this place after a long time. I remember coming here with children from Dharampur in 2017, I believe.

Buying plants and setting up composting is still pending.

Me, Bansi, and Nidhi went to Kamla Cafe for dinner and walked back home.
We had a chat about life until late night.

### Watching

We started watching [Angoor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215517/).

### Reading

Nidhi and I read a small book about [Jenu Kuruba Tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenu_Kuruba).


The Jenu Kuruba are a tribal group from the Nilgiris, numbering around 37,000.They are concentrated in the districts bordering the states of Kerala and Karnataka. 
'Jenu' means 'honey' in Kannada, referring to their traditional occupation as collectors of honey in the forest.
