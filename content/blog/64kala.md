- **Kalā (कला)** refers to a specialized skill, art, or science a cultivated capacity that blends practical technique, aesthetic sensibility, and deeper philosophical grounding.
- Traditionally, the 64 Kalās are considered a comprehensive set of human accomplishments - spanning arts, crafts, sciences, and life skills - aimed at holistic development.
- Never seen as **"hobbies"** but as integral parts of education, contributing to a balanced personality physical, intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual.
- **Interconnected:** Many Kalās integrate Ganita Vidyā, āyurveda, music theory, vāstu, and philosophy.
- **Pedagogical:** Traditionally taught through gurukula, apprenticeship, and paramparā, blending experiential learning with scriptural study.

#### How can we include these things in life of 3 to 8yr old children ?

- At this age, skills are given in seed form — not as formal training but through play, rhythm, imitation, and imagination.

- The teacher/parent’s role is to model beauty, order, joy → the child “absorbs” the Kalās naturally.

- Many Kalās that in Indian tradition appear as refined arts (music, crafts, riddles) are given through playful, child-suitable forms.

- We can includes some things as long term practice, some things as one of exposures. For example we can include art, hand work, music, drama in schedule as long term practice. Weaving cloth kind of thing as one of learning experience / project theme.
