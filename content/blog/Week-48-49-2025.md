### 24th Nov to 30th Nov (Monday to Sunday) , 1st Dec to 7th Dec 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

Again I am writing a bi-weekly note. Life is going super fast... ups and downs... twists and turns...

I am not going to spend much time writing this note. I will get some time during the last week of this month. So I will write a longer reflective note at that time.

**24th to 28th Nov (Mon to Fri)** - office work

**29th Nov (Saturday)** - We went to see a play called 'Welcome Zindagi' by Saumya Joshi and team. It was long due for me. Finally I watched it. Nidhi also enjoyed it.

**1st to 7th Dec**

- Finally we got confirmation that we need to vacate the house we are living in right now.

We finalized a 1BHK house in a nearby area with the help of a broker. It's a nice independent house with a balcony. (After a long time we are going to get a house with a balcony). We will do the shifting at the end of this month.

- Other days mostly office work & sessions with children.

- I took work from home on the 3rd. Apart from office work, I visited Children's University, Gandhinagar. I met Vishal Bhadani & Mahendra Sir. Attended a session on 'possible research areas in primary education'. Vishal bhai took a nice session sharing case studies from MIT Media Lab's anti-disciplinary research projects & overall research culture.

- After that we sat to discuss one very interesting project - developing an integrated learning module for grade 4 children. It will contain activities which integrate science - math - language, everything... it can be stories, projects, songs, games, films and more. I am going to be part of this project.

- I was very tired on the 4th, feeling feverish so I took off that day.

**Sunday** - [We started cataloging all our books from the home library](https://www.instagram.com/p/DR9dGdHDH2T/?img_index=1). Mostly children's literature and nature-centric books. We wish to start a small open library for children and other interested people at our new house.


I have put up a [volunteering post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/learningwalamihir_mihirs-backround-activity-7400865390404382720-2Pad?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADUscKkBQYwcjcCaopf3DpAVtI9YokgmFrM). Lots of very interesting responses and requests came up. I'm so glad that I did it. I need to manage my time and energy because I got lots of responses.
