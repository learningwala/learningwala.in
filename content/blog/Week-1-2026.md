### 29th Dec 2025 to 4th Jan 2026(Mon to Sunday)

- 29th to 31st Dec 2025 - Large-scale event at office

- 1st and 2nd Jan 2026 - Office work 

- 3rd Jan 2026 - Saturday, I was at home. In the morning, I was reading about the work of an organization called [Nazariya Art Collective](https://www.nazariacollective.in/). Later, I spent time writing my year-end reflection - [2025 Reflection](https://learningwala.in/blog/2025-reflections/). In the evening, Mummy and I went to [Hardik Dave's Shabad Parikrama](https://www.instagram.com/iktara.shabad/?hl=en) at Shreyash Amphitheatre.

- 4th Jan 2026 - Sunday, I was at home the whole day. I had a check-in call with my friend/mentor [Jaya Ramchandani](https://welearnwegrow.medium.com/). We had a brief discussion about how to document our work, how to build a portfolio, and how to stay connected with our network. I felt happy after the call. Thank you, Jaya, for your prompt reply and for agreeing for the call.

I really like Sandeep Khare's music. A 10-year-old Marathi girl from BeMe Alternative School helped me discover this music. She really loves his songs. Her father introduced her to his work.

Next week one of my friend and Mahendra Sir is coming to Ahmadabad. + some meetings are lined up so I will be little busy. It is good actually.. I am missing Nidhi. She is with her family because of medical emergency.
