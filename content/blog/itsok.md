It is okay if I do not want to start my own NGO because I am afraid that I will not be able to raise funds, or because I am worried that my program will not align with traditional measurement tools. 

It is okay if I do not want to start 'classes' or a learning center, or take paid workshops where I constantly market myself, where parents look at my practice as a product and themselves as customers. 

It is okay if I do not belong to any specific subject or age group, because I am afraid that the conventional schooling system will choke my creativity and experimentality. 

It is okay to be an independent educator, working with small groups of children, creating unconventional learning experiences and collaborate with others 

It is difficult to work on your own terms and sustain as an independent educator in this complex ecosystem, but I am slowly learning to hold this complexity & finding new ways to engage with it.

I am happy to share that last year, Nidhi and I collaborated and engaged with around 12 organizations all over India—ranging from nature education, primary schools, organizations working with youth, child development, peace education, maker spaces/self-directed learning, and design education. We contributed whatever we could, apart from our full-time jobs. I really felt happy about our work.

45+ learning calls, 20+ sessions with children, 1 Residential Camp, 15+ teachers were engaged, 1 learning module got created + new friendships, laughter and love.

We also got supported by Vijaya Foundation and Nagarathna Memorial Grant

Think about it—we are now part of the impact story of every organization we engaged with.

What a great way to start the new year.

I am very very grateful to everyone who supported this journey.
