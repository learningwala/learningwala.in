### 22nd Dec to 28th Dec 2025 (Mon to Sunday)

A brief update this week. At the office, our pilot project with children is coming to an end. We are preparing the assessment framework, post-tests, and children's portfolios.

There's a major event on campus from the 28th to 30th of December, so everyone at the office is busy with preparations for that.

Since this is the last week of the year and I need to be present for the campus event, I won't be getting a break right now. That's alright—I'll take some time off in January instead.
