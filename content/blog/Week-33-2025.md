#### 11th to 17th Aug 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

I have started my naturopathy treatment again. It is for my stomach pain (while eating outside food, slightly spicy food, or some specific foods) and headaches (during evening time, after long screen time, or during high temperatures). The naturopathy center is very close to our home. It is called [Vasant Nature Cure](https://vasantnaturecurehospital.com/). I was amazed after reading the history of this initiative. Really inspiring work.

Tuesday to Thursday I was busy at the office, mostly working with children and other tasks.

It was a long weekend: 15th August, Janmashtami, and Sunday.

This time we decided to celebrate Janmashtami at home. Nidhi was super duper excited. Initially we were planning to go to Dharmpur for a short trip and had even booked tickets, but we canceled the plan at the last minute mainly because I was feeling low and tired, not wanting to travel.

Friday we did prep for Janmashtami, and Saturday evening we celebrated it wholeheartedly. I invited a few friends but they couldn't join. One of my office colleagues / friend joined and helped us a lot with cooking and preparation of the whole thing. I am very grateful to her. I was so happy looking at Nidhi. She was super happy. She had a long-standing wish to celebrate Janmashtami at home, and I am glad that we could make this happen.

I have found one [beautiful temple](https://ahmedabad.chinmayamission.com/our-centre/) near our home, where I can spend some quiet time after my office hours. I am planning to go at least twice a week.

Saturday morning, as usual, I attended my Indian Knowledge System online course. I am enjoying it. [Here](blog/iks/) I made some basic notes about my understanding.

I am working on one project with [Srivi](https://www.sriviliveshere.com/), which is around Indian Aesthetics and education. I need to give more time to reading and researching for the same.

Sunday we went to our office colleague's home. We had lunch there and spent the evening at the River front. We also visited [Navjeevan Publication Book store](https://www.instagram.com/navajivantrust/?hl=en). I bought two books:

We also visited the very interesting [analog photography exhibition](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNfxMKkv7Vc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) at the same place.

I have realized that I am more drawn to poems, essays, and short stories or character sketches. I am not able to finish novels or long-form writing.

These days I am more interested in Tagore's work and philosophy, so I'm looking forward to the book I brought about Tagore. I also like to write essays, so this time I am going to study from the other book, which is a compilation of essays from the best authors in Gujarati language.

We are getting into a routine slowly. I am learning to 'let it go,' release tensions and many unlearnings. I am trusting the universe. Slowly we will make sure that we wake up early, do yoga, eat healthy food, and work with a fresh and happy mind. What else is a happy life? For me this is the lifelong goal - to be in touch with your true nature and live each and every moment choicefully.

**Our study tables:**

Nowadays I am only able to focus on my full-time work plus some research on IKS. All the other projects are kind of paused. I am taking it slowly. I am actually enjoying the work I am doing with children at my office. I am seriously thinking of shifting my focus to early childhood education and working more deeply in that area. Let's see.

This month we spent beyond our budget on shopping and festival stuff, but it's okay.
