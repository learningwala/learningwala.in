#### 21th July to 27th July 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

[હરિ મારુ ગાડું ક્યાં લઇ જાય કાંઈ ન જાણું.....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uZznwrfaos&list=RD_uZznwrfaos&start_radio=1) 

ધરમ કરમ ના બાંધ્યા બળદિયા 

ધીરજની લગામ તાણી 

કાંઈ ન જાણું 

સુખને દુઃખના પૈડાં ઉપર ગાડું ચાલતું જાય 

કદી ઉગે આશાનો સૂરજ , કદી અંધારું થાય

This week was healing for me. There were ups and downs, but overall it ended on a good note.

Monday to Friday was mostly office work. Soon I will start taking sessions with children apart from sitting at my desk and working on my laptop.

---

Wednesday & Thursday - Nidhi went to Mitali ben's school - Kanisa (Khambhat) for taking sessions with children. It went well. She is going to continue this engagement. She will go to take sessions once a month.

I feel so happy to see Nidhi taking sessions with children and spending time with teachers. She is in her real avatar when she is with children and teachers who love her. I wish she gets more and more opportunities to spend time with lovely people and nature.

----

Friday I went to physiotherapy for my back pain. It was unbearable. Physiotherapy gives temporary relief, but I need to do regular exercises. I must join a regular yoga class. Waking up early is a little bit difficult for me - I have spoiled myself. But I will definitely join the 7am yoga class batch and see how it goes for a month.

Saturday & Sunday were fully packed.

Saturday I attended two workshops from the office: 'Indian Aesthetics' and 'Games & Activities for Neurodivergent Children'. I enjoyed attending the Indian aesthetics workshop. It is validating my personal educational philosophy, which is mostly inspired by J. Krishnamurti, Martin Buber, and a few other philosophers.

I published a blog post on [Indian Art & Aesthetics](https://learningwala.in/blog/indian-art-aesthetics/) after listening to Udayan Bajpayee's lecture.

I had my regular learning call with the Sanjhe Sapne team. It is going well.

We went to the park in the evening and had a good 30-minute walk. Nidhi took a bath in the rain in the evening - she enjoyed it a lot.

---

Sunday morning we had a good walk at the park and breakfast.

We tried making our daily schedule and list of projects in hand.

Sunday evening was wonderful. We went to ['Shabad Parikrama by Hardik Dave'](https://www.instagram.com/iktara.shabad/). It was a long-held wish and dream to go to this event with Nidhi. She didn't understand all the Gujarati verses, but she still enjoyed the overall vibes. I am very grateful to Hardik Dave and his team for organizing events like this. Please explore his Instagram to know more about his work.

My grandfather was a bhajanik - he was running a bhajan mandali. Hardik's work reminds me of him.

---

We have ordered a study table for Nidhi. It arrived, but we need to assemble it.

I observed that my Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn feeds are all filled with posts about 'people working on laptops'. I was looking for inspiration where someone is working with children and sharing their process, behind the scenes, struggles... I see that an educator's process is like an actor's process.

Adulting is at its peak - we are discussing everything about cooking, washing, shopping, and many household things.

I reached out to two or three people with requests for interesting learning projects. All replied in a positive manner. Let me process it. Hopefully something interesting and meaningful is coming up.

---

Overall, things are okay. I am also in a better state of mind. I am planning to make a mood board at home about my work and inspiration. Ideas are welcome.
