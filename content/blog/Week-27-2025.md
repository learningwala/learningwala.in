#### 30th June to 6th July 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

#### Health

This week was difficult. My mental health is in a very bad phase.
Over the last few months, I somehow managed, but now it’s hitting me hard. I’m not able to concentrate on work.
Feeling anxious, being zoned out, sleep cycle disturbed. I’m feeling that everything is meaningless.
I’ve started therapy. Let’s see how it goes. It’s costly, but at this point in time, I want to invest in my health.
I am very grateful for Nidhi's support.

We bought health supplements for both of us long back, but haven’t started taking them yet.
Yesterday, Nidhi made a nice poster with the timings and names of the supplements.
So… let’s begin!

I want do yoga regularly, wish me luck !!

Nidhi has been unwell for the last few days. Stomach pain — maybe because of outside food in this weather. She’s better today.

#### Personal Website

I’ve made some changes to my website hosting setup. I started with a GitHub repo + GitHub Pages, where I edited my files on my local machine, built the Hugo site, and pushed it to the Git repo. It got published on GitHub Pages.

Then I moved to Cloudflare Pages, where I edited and built the Hugo site and pushed the public folder to CF Pages.

I have different machines at the office and at home. In the CF Pages setup, I wasn’t able to edit my site during my office chai breaks.
Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t want to wait until I sit at my personal laptop to publish them. So I went back to GitHub.

Now, I’ve put all my content files on the Git repo, and CF Pages builds the Hugo site automatically. Now I can edit my files on the Git repo from the browser.
I tried using Git through the command line, but my office laptop is Windows, so it was difficult. It didn’t even understand some file names — some error came because of that.
WSL is not allowed to download, so finally, the browser was my saviour.

I was concerned about the repo size because I publish images in every weekly note.
I’m using Hugo’s image optimization shortcode which converts images into WebP, resizes them, and makes them responsive — so I’m hopeful.

In short, now I can log in to GitHub and edit my site (very basic functions like adding a new post or editing an existing post).

btw I have added small little black dot as favicon :)

#### Meet up :

Jitu (one of the members from our Sakha community) visited us on Friday. He studies Electronics and Communication at LD Engineering College, Ahmedabad. We talked about AI, programming, life, nature, climate change, and what not… We had nice [Jamnagri Ghughra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXKNCSkVweU) near our home and took a lovely walk at Eklavya Sports Campus.

> Jamnagari Ghughra is a savory, fried pastry from Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, featuring a spicy potato and pea filling. It's a popular street food, often enjoyed with spicy and sweet chutneys. The dish is known for its crispy outer layer and flavorful stuffing.

#### What else?

Khojbeen Mandali is on pause because of the rain. Other projects are also running slow...
This month, I’ll take things slow. Do some rejuvenation for myself and come back with fresh energy.

We’re trying to post regular content on the Khojbeen Mandali [Instagram handle](https://www.instagram.com/khojbeen_mandali/).
Please follow us if you haven’t already!

#### Food and Us

Nidhi made wonderful dhokli today… it reminded me of mom.
(Dhokli is a traditional Gujarati dish — wheat flour dumplings simmered in a tangy, spiced lentil curry. Comfort food at its best.)
