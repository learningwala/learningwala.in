### Inspiration is a Beautiful Cycle

Note by Janantik Shukla

101: 3-Day Mobile Filmmaking Workshop with Sakha Fellows at Vadodara and Nareshwar.

Inspiration is a beautiful cycle for any artist. When we inspire the younger generation, they return the favor with their fresh energy, new stories, and poetry. In the process, we find ourselves traveling back to our own younger days.

Personally, after spending time with the students during this workshop, I felt recharged—ready to face clients, making pitch, the frustration of delayed payments, and the rejections that come with keep creating and capturing beautiful stories on screen.

During the three-day workshop, we explored theatre, visual storytelling, and memory exercises. We also screened a range of short films and a feature. As part of a storytelling exercise, the students initially came up with a web series idea that couldn’t be filmed in just half a day. So they pivoted and developed four new stories—all centered around the river.

Out of those four, they managed to shoot and edit two films. While the films are still in the first-cut stage, I’ll share them once they’re ready.

Super proud of the Sakha Fellows!

Thanks Mihir Pathak for wonderful opportunity.

We set out to explore our river — its deep connection with life, its biodiversity, and the rich socio-cultural stories that flow alongside it.

Taking baby steps, we began this journey through the powerful medium of film making. With the amazing Janantik Shukla guiding us, we discovered new ways of seeing and storytelling.

The Sakha Fellowship volunteer group successfully hosted an inspiring 3-day Filmmaking Workshop, engaging 25 enthusiastic students from high school and college. Led by Janantik Shukla, the workshop began with an exciting day in Vadodara, followed by a two-day residential camp near the serene Narmada River.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our incredible mentors - Ashish Bhangaokar, Rameshwari Gajjar, and Mihir Pathak - whose guidance made this journey truly transformative.

From scripting and shooting to editing and storytelling, the workshop was a perfect blend of learning and fun, sparking creativity and collaboration among all participants.

Thank you to everyone who made this experience unforgettable!
