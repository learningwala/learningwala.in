## 30th Sep to 5th Oct 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

I am writing this on Monday and the ongoing week is super duper hectic, so I am keeping this weekly note short.

I am still in garba fever... still listening to Hardik Dave garba... *"Khamma Khamma Khodiar Re Jogmaya"*... my current tune while I am driving to the office on my Activa. I remember my dadaji whenever I see Hardik's work. My dadaji used to sing garba during Navratri at Jaspur Village. He used to run a bhajan mandali in the village and sing Narayan Bapu's and Gangasati's bhajans.

| Date | Day | Events |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 30th Sep | Tue  | It was Ashtami - office work |
| 1st Oct | Wed | Navmi - we went to Durga Puja after office. We ate sondesh and pakora. Watched dhunuchi dance |
| 2nd Oct | Thu | Dussehra, Gandhi Jayanti - we ate fafda jalebi at home |
| 3rd Oct | Fri | Office |
| 4th Oct | Sat | We went to naturopathy. Doctor said I am on the right path in my treatment. She changed my diet a little bit. But still I have very limited options to eat. Nidhi's health is not well. I think it is a viral infection |
| 5th Oct | Sun | I went to attend a lecture **'What is Presence?'** It was by a practitioner of spiritual practice called Fourth Way by Gurdjieff |

I first heard about Gurdjieff from Mahendra sir, I think. I don't remember clearly. I think he only shared about how his father was a sanyasi at Madhavpur Osho Ashram.

**Documentary on Madhavpur Osho Ashram:**

Then I accidentally found a documentary on Swami Brahmvedantaji on YouTube, where he explained about G's work. I somehow got the contact details of the person who made the documentary - Ronak Seth (son of Darshan Seth who was a follower at the same place). I emailed him... I am talking about 2019.

Then I forgot... I keep coming back to G's work. 1-2 years ago I discovered the work of Hardik Dave. He and his father Praful Dave are also Osho sanyasis from Madhavpur. So I keep listening about Madhavpur and G. I read about him on the internet.

I was reading about it on Sunday afternoon. I typed in a search box: **"Gurdjieff in Ahmedabad"** and I got the Living Presence website and then Ahmedabad center Facebook page, and I got to know about the lecture happening in exactly 1 hour, just 5km away from my house.

I grabbed the opportunity. I bought some books also, saw Ronak there and met Darshan bhai.

I am so grateful to the universe for this.

I am slowly practicing self-remembering whenever I find a chance in a day. Baby steps...
