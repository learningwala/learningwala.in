### 19th to 25th Jan 2026 (Mon to Sunday)

**Mon to Fri -** mostly office work.

Monday we met Raj. Had a nice discussion children litreture, language and offcourse 'developmental sector'.

**Friday evening**, office friends came to home. It was a long overdue visit.

**Saturday -** In the evening, I visited [Vidyun Foundation](https://vidyun.org/)'s learning center. Met Devki and Vishnu.

They are doing interesting work with young adults in the Rakhial area of Ahmedabad. They want to focus on English literacy with children. Right now, they are experimenting with project-based learning, focusing on how children can learn reading, writing, speaking, and listening through this. For example: making newsletters, making videos, preparing drama, and more.

I liked their facilitation style. I suggested doing more library activities like storytelling, watching films together... this will help children get new vocabulary and listening skills, which will ultimately help with speaking, writing, and reading everywhere.

They also want to start a micro school next year. I want to collaborate with them more. Let's see how it turns out.

**Sunday -** We went to [Navjeevan Trust campus](https://www.instagram.com/navajivantrust/?hl=en) with our children's book collection. They are hosting a reading club/reading space for adults. We wanted to see if we could introduce a reading club for children. We offered our children's book collection for the same.

It was our first visit. We found that children are not coming to the space. We need to promote it in a better way so the footfall of children increases.
I bought [Gujarati essay book called 'Vaadh'](https://www.amazon.in/Vaadh-%E0%AA%B5%E0%AA%BE%E0%AA%A2-Nilesh-Gohil/dp/B0FPCD7QF5) from farmer's market at Navjeevan. The author of the book is acully farmer and he was selling the book along with honey he harvested form his farm.

In the afternoon, office friends came for lunch. We ate baingan bharta, gajar halwa, dal, roti... it was a nice afternoon brunch. I feel that this is what life is all about—spending time with family and friends who love you, care for you. Till now, work was driving all the chapters in my life, but now slowly I am investing in friendships, relationships. Yes, it takes effort to nurture these things. It is not always effortless and natural; you need to create space for it.

Meanwhile, I am writing lots of short stories for children. In my office also, we need stories to put as examples in our curriculum, and apart from that, I am writing new stuff so we can publish as a book or magazine through Eklavya or self-publication.

I am so happy and feeling grateful to the universe that I am getting the opportunity/time/resources to basically work on children's literature.

Other things are good overall. I am learning to not take stress in small things.

Nidhi is also settling down in her workplace. She is leading an after-school program called '[Young Naturalist](https://www.instagram.com/p/DT25j1IDFZQ/?hl=en&img_index=1)' at her workplace, where she will design and facilitate a nature education program with young children. I am so happy that she is getting the opportunity to work with children + nature education.
