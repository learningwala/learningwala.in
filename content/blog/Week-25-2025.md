#### 16th June to 22nd June 2025 (Monday to Sunday)

This week was not very hectic, but not too slow either. Overall, it was a good week, work-wise.
On Monday and Tuesday, we spent time with the Nature Classroom team.

Nidhi visited Mumbai to facilitate a workshop. She felt very confident while facilitating the session and really enjoyed it. I felt so happy seeing her journey as a facilitator/educator. I‚Äôm so grateful to be a small part of her journey, and that she is part of mine.

On Saturday and Sunday, I spent time finishing small tasks that had been pending for a long time‚Äîgiving feedback, replying to emails, and more.

I enjoyed working on my desk

I had a call with two of my friends to discuss their learning pathways and career paths. In the development sector‚Äîespecially when you're working with an NGO in the education space‚Äîyour growth is not always predictable or linear. It‚Äôs not like the corporate world, where you get promotions at regular intervals.
What if you want to remain an educator, continue working directly with children, and still grow in other aspects of life‚Äîmoney, new skills, new kinds of learning, or new types of projects?
What if you don‚Äôt see ‚ÄúProject Manager‚Äù as your next goal?
What should a growth pathway look like that gives you enough challenges to stay inspired, helps you feel meaning in your work, and shifts as you move through different life phases?

I have developed a questionnaire for personal reflection. Whenever I consider changing my job / taking new project, I ask myself these questions. This time, I shared them with friends who are also looking for clarity and new ideas. Let‚Äôs see if it helps. Let me know if you‚Äôre interested in a framework to think about your next move‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy to share it. We can even have a one-on-one call to brainstorm and explore together.

This framework includes reflecting on your personal philosophy / values, strengths, interests, learning aspirations, financial needs, and cultural/social/emotional needs. It's also useful for documenting your past work and building your portfolio.

I‚Äôve been sharing some thoughts on self-directed learning and portfolio-making with the *Sanjhe Sapne* team. We're having weekly learning calls, and I‚Äôm enjoying them so much.

I‚Äôm also working with the YouCAN ‚Äì Earth Educator Fellows, sharing my insights about working with children and developing programs. I‚Äôm learning a lot from each one of them. As an alum of this fellowship, I feel very grateful for the opportunity to stay connected with like-minded and like-hearted people.

A big part of my work revolves around:

* Sharing tools and creating environments for self-directed learning

I feel the need to start documenting my frameworks and ideas‚Äîmaybe that will be the topic for my next blog post.

#### Sakha Fellowship Updates :

Sakhaz are working on two projects. One is an inquiry project around rural/village issues. They‚Äôve prepared a survey form and visited a village near Waghodia. The second project is about interviewing unsung heroes. They started by interviewing a 100-year-old *masi* who runs a *sev-usal* shop in Vadodara.

We both feel so happy seeing the updates, but unfortunately, we haven‚Äôt been able to engage with the Sakhaz in person. We only get Saturdays and Sundays off ‚Äî and those are usually packed with our other project meetings, home maintenance work, and a bit of downtime. That‚Äôs also when the Sakha team meets in Vadodara.

Technically, Vadodara is just 3 hours away, but it takes us 1 hour just to get to a place from where we can catch a bus. We‚Äôd need to leave work early on Friday evening, and we don‚Äôt have a place to stay in Vadodara either. So, all of this makes it really difficult‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôll find a way to join in somehow.

We really miss the energy and connection with the Sakhaz.

The rest of the week was mostly filled with office work.
This week was also filled with some existential questions‚Äî
Is my work worth doing?
Am I on the right path?
What is my relationship with money, and with my employer?

I don‚Äôt know why, but I feel like I‚Äôm in a phase of life where my ambitions to ‚Äúmake it big‚Äù or ‚Äúbe successful‚Äù in the conventional sense are getting quieter. I‚Äôm okay with slow and small now.
What‚Äôs calling me more is building meaningful relationships‚Äîwith peers, friends, partner, family, the larger ecosystem and support system. I want to invest in that, rather than chasing individual success. Supporting friends in finding their paths, doing projects together, sharing ideas, contacts, networks, resources‚Äîwithout guarding them. Meeting people without agendas. Just being grateful and feeling enough‚Äîfor who I am and who others are.

I‚Äôm slowly becoming less aggressive about pushing my own ideas‚Äîtrying to learn the art of listening, of understanding other perspectives.

Over the last few months‚Äîconflicts at home, changing dynamics at work, and the deepening of my relationship with my partner‚Äîhave all changed me.
Maybe it‚Äôs just age.I have turned 30 this May.

I was also feeling anxious during parts of this week because of some work tasks, but somehow I managed. Writing and journaling help‚Äîthey slow down my thoughts and help me feel calm. 

I‚Äôm considering therapy to work on my overall mental health, which has been affected by multiple things over the past few months.

Anyway‚Ä¶ it was a good week.

On Sunday, I watched an old Marathi web series and listened to some beautiful, slow Hindi and Marathi songs.
