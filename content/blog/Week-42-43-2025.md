## 13th to 19th Oct 2025 (week 42) 20th to 26th Oct 2025 (week 43)

Again, this time I am clubbing notes from the last two weeks. My office has started, so I really don't have the bandwidth to write detailed notes. I'm putting informative notes here and adding very short emotional note/reflection also, I will add on in this note later.

---

**Mon** - drama practice at office

**Tue** - we performed the drama

**Wed** - I took WFH and left for Kanpur 

**Thu to Sunday** - at Kanpur 

**In my free time I discovered Gujarati bhajans by:**

- Devraj Gadhvi (Nano Dero)
- Kandas Bapu 
- Narayan Swami 
- Gangasati 

I remembered my dadaji...

There was chaos at Nidhi's home because of the joint family and because Nidhi's family runs a readymade garment shop. Diwali/festival is peak time for sales, so everyone was busy handling shop and home stuff together.

We watched Jolly LLB 3 movie on Saturday. It was a 3:40 PM show and almost the whole hall was empty. 

I really liked the film. I was wondering how Akshay Kumar did this film... but then realized that the film is not pointing towards the government but business houses. So it's a safe play. 

**Sunday** - went to Nidhi's nani's house.

**I was reading about...**
[What is special about the Kindergarten in Auroville?](https://auroville.org/page/what-is-special-about-the-kindergarten-in-auroville-%3F)

**Mon** - Diwali pooja

**What I liked in Banaras:**

- Banaras ki gali (food, small old shops, homes full of aesthetics)
- I was curious about the overall place where there are 100s of temples, the whole city is full of temples, Ganga is there, Sarnath is there, Manikarnika Ghat is there... it is the oldest city... why is this place so important?

**What I didn't like:**

Commercialization of everything—food, water, visit to temple, pooja, everything... Nobody is agendaless here... everyone has something to sell... I sometimes feel afraid to talk to anyone... but still there are old, small, slow shops which run with ethics...

**Shopping:**

Apart from tasting different food, we bought some interesting stuff from Banaras:
- Tibetan singing bowl 
- Manjira
- Yoyo toy
- Small toy boat 
- Paper mache lamp and woolen handmade lamp 
- Buddha statue made from stone 
- Nidhi bought some earrings and nose rings

**About Nidhi's home:**

There was chaos, people were loud, but I really felt free there, felt loved. I loved going to Nidhi's nani's house and meeting people. I really liked the food at Nidhi's place. My stomach was well during those days.

**About train raide :**

it was 24hrs train ride from Kanpur to Ahemdabad. I first time watched movies during the journey. I watched Gujrati movie called vanilla ice cream. it was wonderful movie. Apart from that I watched marathi movie called Asehi Ekada Vhave (असेही एकदा व्हावे). That was also nice light movie. 

during the journey I got cold and cough. 

Nidhi taught me one new game, we played it in my notebook. I liked it.
