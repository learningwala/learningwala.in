- Developing module / workshop around 'Geo inquiry projects' or Using maps for geo inquiry projects'
- Working on activity module on nature education for kindergarten children

I’ve been thinking of taking a break from my full-time job for about 2–3 months to engage in an internship or volunteer with meaningful projects.

I’m especially interested in research, interventions, or facilitation work around the following areas:

- Nature education
- Development of environmental aesthetic sense, especially from an Indic perspective
- Exploration of the affective domain with primary grade children
- Project-based and integrated learning approaches in early childhood education

Anything related to environmental education, Aesthetics, Indic Perspective, Neuroscience

There are no monetary expectations from my side for this project. Since I haven’t been part of formal college education, I’ve felt the need over the years to find learning opportunities beyond professional, outcome-driven roles. I long for a phase where I can simply be a student again.

(I have started one learning journey with [Dr.Srivi Kalyan](https://www.sriviliveshere.com/) on above topics. I will update more detail soon)
