<p>Hi, This is Mihir Pathak aka learningwala</p>
<p>I am passionate educator.</p>
<p>I never been to formal school after completing 10th grade. Later, I completed my 12th grade and pursued a BA in Sociology as an external student. I am working with children since the age of 18.</p>
<p>Instead of going to school, I spent time exploring website &amp; software development, sales &amp; marketing, theater, writing, design, technology, entrepreneurship and many more interests.</p>
<p>I started working with children through sharing how to use computer, exploring <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">&lsquo;MIT Scratch&rsquo;</a> , making <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta toys</a>, telling stories, playing games and more.</p>
<p><strong>Slowly after lots of experimentation I realized that :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I like being with children &amp; young adults, I can be my self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I can do creative experiments &amp; explorations with them, which I can&rsquo;t do in school or university.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started volunteering in different schools, meeting inspiring, passionate educators and children, visited different learning spaces across India, read books &amp; attended workshops.</p>
<p>And that’s how my journey started as an educator, which is evolving every day.</p>
<p>During this decade long journey, I worked in a formal &amp; informal learning spaces across India. Did friendship with many children &amp; educators.</p>
<p><strong>I create transformative learning journeys for children, young adults and educators using experiential methodologies, including theater, nature-based explorations, and interdisciplinary projects.</strong></p>
<p>My programs, workshops and intervention are just an anchor. My strong intention is to create a space of healing, acceptance, and co-creation.</p>
<p>A space which act as an incubation center for everyone.Where we learn, experiment, challenge ourselves, and thereby break barriers and grow in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>My current core interest areas are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the role of love &amp; Relationship in education</li>
<li>Project based learning, Self directed learning &amp; non formal learning spaces</li>
<li>Child development &amp; learning</li>
<li>Language pedagogy, children literature &amp; theater in education</li>
<li>Life skills education and ecological consciousness / nature education</li>
<li>Citizen Science Projects, Environment, Civics, Cultural projects for larger good</li>
</ul>
<p>My work is deeply inspired by the philosophies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti">J. Krishnamurti</a>, <a href="https://infed.org/mobi/martin-buber-on-education/">Martin Buber</a> , and the science of brain, learning, and child development.</p>
<p><strong>Currently,</strong></p>
<p>I am working with formal and informal learning environments in different capacities. Where I work directly with children, young adults, educators, researchers and learning experience designers.<em>You can read about my current engagements at <a href="/now/">&rsquo;now&rsquo;</a> page</em></p>
<p>I am part of the faculty team for the <a href="https://www.eklavya.in/about-us-eklavya/what-we-do-eklavya-new/courses-and-workshops/child-development-special-needs-and-learning-a-certificate-course">&lsquo;Child Development, Learning &amp; Special Needs&rsquo;</a> course at Eklavya Foundation, Bhopal. And a proud recipient of the Earth Educator Fellowship (2022-23), supported by the <a href="https://www.youcan.in/">Youth Conservation Action Network</a>.</p>
<p>As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.</p>
<p>When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.</p>
