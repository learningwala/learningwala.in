  <ul>
<li>How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?</li>
<li>What helped me?</li>
<li>What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?</li>
<li>What enables people to live a self - directed life ?</li>
</ul>
<p>if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people</p>
<p>to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness</p>
<p>think about the 16 year old boy or girl from small city like Vadodara, middle class family</p>
<ul>
<li>got typical education from school</li>
<li>no idea what career options / study options are available apart from typical sci, commerce and arts streams</li>
<li>no self confidence, very little self worth, no particular interests or ambition</li>
<li>easily get influenced by advertisements and media. No critical thinking lens</li>
</ul>
<p>In my journey what are the differentiators ?</p>
<p>the foundation is same but,</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to work on real life projects
I met people + spaces who don&rsquo;t judge, believe in you and give you the platform. Which ultimately become my tribe / community</p>
<p>How can I create this for friends and peers in Vadodara and my hometown Padra ?</p>
<p>Can project based learning become a starting point ?</p>
<p>Do one research / making / solving/entrepreneurship project around your city. Your questions, your ideas.</p>
<p>I will connect you with subject matter expert, will fund your project, will connect you with further opportunity  (internship / course / job / funding / learning)</p>
<p>This gives you non judgemental space, self confidence, you work in team, express yourself creatively and much more.</p>
<p>after the project done you becomes part of khoji community and keep doing interesting stuff</p>
<p>we will try to guide you for career opportunity, other learning opportunities</p>
<p>Local khoji is a distillation of ideas which I have been dreaming of for years.
Give unconventional, transformative learning experience to children.</p>
<p>This is not a CSR project / Not a NGO, it is just an initiative. I am very much open for collaboration
I am ready to share all my learnings / ideas / support  if you want to start local khoji at your town, your org, your school, your community. It can fit in your existing programs, curriculum and timetables.</p>
