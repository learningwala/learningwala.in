  <h4 id="21st-to-27th-april-2025-monday-to-sunday">21st to 27th April 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>This week was again a roller coaster ride. Too much is happening. I am not getting the mindspace to write this weekly note in detail, so I am just putting down pointers.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal office day. After a long weekend, all teammates gathered and had a nice catch-up.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took leave. Nidhi and I went to Vadodara. Mom came back with us. The home situation is not well.</p>
<p>We had a clay workshop in the office. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions with children at the learning center are on pause because of summer vacation. They will resume in June. Nowadays, she is working on developing project-based nature education modules for grades 6 to 9.</p>
<p>Mummy was sharing about having difficulty in reading. Nidhi and Mummy went to Lenskart and got a new pair of glasses. Lenskart made the whole eye test and spectacle buying experience very smooth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.earthfocus.in/">Earth Focus</a> team sent a copy of &lsquo;Stop, Look and Wonder,&rsquo; their nature education curriculum. I had the opportunity to review the curriculum while they were developing it last year.</p>

<p>I shared learning resources on the following topics through blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/childhoodinindia/">Childhood in India</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/play/">Education and Play</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/reflectivewriting/">Reflective Writing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I watched this podcast again to get inspired by the wonderful work they are doing:</p>

<p>The Papon concert got canceled due to the Kashmir incident. Both the artist and organizer decided to cancel it, and we got a full refund. It was going to be our first concert experience.</p>
<p>We bought a big plastic drum to start our composting journey. We still need to get soil.</p>
<p>At the office, we hosted a nature education session with children. Nidhi also joined for it. I am so glad and grateful that she could come. She is always a big support and inspiration for me. I am very grateful to my office team also for initiating and being part of it.</p>

<p>I played &lsquo;Cards Against Humanity&rsquo; for the first time. It was horrible! :) But I enjoyed games that are language-heavy, where you need to make jokes, play with vocabulary, and talk in metaphors. I will write in detail about this in another post.</p>

<p>Finally, we bought a 70L cooler from Vijay Sales. We wanted to buy from a local manufacturer/non-branded cooler because it&rsquo;s cheaper, but we couldn&rsquo;t find any shops selling them. So finally, we went to Croma but didn&rsquo;t get good rates. Eventually, we bought it from Vijay Sales.</p>
<p>We have two bedrooms, and we tried setting up the cooler so both rooms get some cool air, allowing us to avoid using the AC. It worked, but we need to keep doors open all night. We&rsquo;re thinking about buying one more small cooler or using the AC in the bedroom&hellip; let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is we didn&rsquo;t get a pipe and noseal in nearby shops. We went to a nearby mall (Mr. DIY), but the pipe was very expensive there. Finally, we found an option on Blinkit that we need to order. I continuously feel that we&rsquo;re getting disconnected from the local ecosystem because of this apartment lifestyle.</p>
<p>Saturday, Nidhi, Mom, and I went to Kamla Cafe for dinner.</p>
<p>Sunday, we had a call with our financial advisor to understand health insurance. It was very interesting to learn how it works. The process to claim insurance is getting stricter because of the many frauds happening in the country. We also had a short discussion about registering our own trust / NGO to facilitate our work with children. Two three already suggested the same thing but we are still thinking about the idea.</p>
<p>I had a call about storytelling and setting up a library space with a teacher working in Kendriya Vidyalaya. She is doing storytelling with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankittellsstories/?originalSubdomain=in">Ankit from TISS Mumbai</a>.</p>
<p>The home situation is getting worse. I am in constant stress and anxiety. Let&rsquo;s hope things get better in the coming week.</p>
