<hr>
<p>This week seemed to fly by. I was still writing last week&rsquo;s note on Tuesday, and now the week is already over.</p>
<hr>
<p>I spent most of this week with the children. As part of my full-time work, I&rsquo;ve become a regular part of the Kindergarten pilot program. I conduct hour-long sessions with the children every day from Tuesday to Friday. When I spend the morning with the children, the entire day becomes enjoyable, though I do get tired afterward. Making 30 children sing songs and do physical activities leaves me feeling a bit drained. It reminds me that I&rsquo;m 30 years old now&hellip; but it&rsquo;s still incredibly fun.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Monday, Nidhi came to the office. All of us office friends gathered together and identified the biodiversity spread across our campus.</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding office work - my office laptop still hasn&rsquo;t been repaired, so I have to think and write in a notebook. (I&rsquo;ve also deleted Instagram and other social media apps from my phone, which helps.) I often find that having a laptop with unlimited internet creates a kind of distraction.</p>
<p>Now, when I have actual work to do, I either ask to borrow someone else&rsquo;s laptop or complete the task on my phone. The laptop at home has essentially become a desktop, so even there - when I need to do real work, I connect to the internet through my phone and work on the big screen. The key is not taking your laptop and phone into the bedroom - that makes a huge difference.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last week I was considering something like publishing blog posts via email, but after talking with friends and doing some reading, I found a new and simple solution: prepare a markdown file in SimpleNote and copy-paste it into GitHub&rsquo;s mobile app. Cloudflare handles the rest. I also tried an app called Git Journal, but encountered some metadata errors, so I stuck with the workflow mentioned above.</p>
<p>This way, even if my laptop isn&rsquo;t available, I can at least update my website from my phone. Of course, I still need a laptop and Linux setup for editing themes and other technical work, but for blog posts (just text), this method works perfectly. I still need to figure out the best way to post images.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Friday evening, I went out for dinner with my office friends. It was enjoyable. The highlights of this week were definitely the time spent with kids and friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday - Raksha Bandhan: Nidhi enjoys celebrating festivals, and I thought it was a day off, we could relax&hellip; but we celebrated it in a small way. We made Shiro/halwa at home and ordered puri sabji from outside. We tied rakhi to each other, shared our feelings of gratitude with the universe, and prayed.</p>
<p>In the evening, I completed some work-related tasks and meetings, then went for a short ride on the Activa.</p>

<p>My health is fine now. Yesterday my blood pressure suddenly dropped, and I felt dizzy. I drank ORS which helped somewhat, but I still have a headache.</p>
<p>Today is mostly about rest and housework, with a little preparation for the work I need to do with the kids starting from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Today Nidhi successfully made dosa on the cast iron tava for the first time. (I forgot to take a photo)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="khojbin-mandali">Khojbin Mandali</h4>
<p>Nidhi conducted two sessions at the Learning Center this week.</p>
<p>In the first session, there was an activity about types of trees and how to identify them.</p>
<p>In the second session, she worked with the children to create a local map and mark trees on it - essentially making a tree map.</p>
<p>After conducting the sessions, Nidhi felt she needed to work on her voice projection, so we did some voice exercises together. I firmly believe that anyone working directly with children should do exercises similar to what actors do. I&rsquo;ll write more about this topic in a separate post.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="other-updates">Other Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>I applied for an IPO for the first time and was successful. So that&rsquo;s my first stock investment!</li>
<li>After much thinking and experimentation, we&rsquo;ve decided to hire a cook for home. (We haven&rsquo;t quite figured out yet whether this is our laziness or a way to save time for other work :))</li>
<li>Nidhi ordered a study table from Amazon, but it hasn&rsquo;t been assembled yet. I figured that instead of struggling with it myself, I&rsquo;d get help from a carpenter.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re experimenting with following a routine together. Slowly, slowly&hellip;</li>
<li>Overall mood is good&hellip; happy, happy..</li>
</ul>
