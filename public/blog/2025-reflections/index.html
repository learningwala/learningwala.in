  <h2 id="personal-milestones">Personal Milestones</h2>
<p><strong>Got married</strong> (2nd Feb 2025)</p>
<p><strong>Shifted to Ahmedabad</strong> — Joined an organization working in Early Childhood Education.</p>
<p><strong>Started <a href="https://www.instagram.com/khojbeen_mandali/">&lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali&rsquo;</a></strong> to work with children &amp; young adults through nature exploration, theater, inquiry projects and more. Got a lot of clarity on my position in the educational space. It is my 12th year in this space. (check out our <a href="https://learningwala.in/offerings/">offerings</a>)</p>
<p><strong>First garba experience</strong> — Played garba for the first time and visited <a href="https://www.instagram.com/navshakti.navratri/?hl=en">Navshakti</a></p>
<p><strong>Fountain pens &amp; microscope</strong> — Bought a <a href="https://makoba.com/collections/pilot-kakuno-fountain-pens?srsltid=AfmBOooXvSJuOox58K1DGBos0zaym8XTkgzU_-uzt1mSdsVb6qyduotU">Pilot Kakuno fountain pen</a> and a few interesting ink bottles. I really like geeking around fountain pens and inks. I also bought a digital microscope this year—very useful to see insects.</p>
<p><strong>This year I explored topics close to my heart</strong> — Indian Knowledge System, Panchkosha, Development of Aesthetic Sense, Development of Affective Domain, and the work of Gurdjieff and Aurobindo.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong> — For the second time in my life, went to a therapist</p>
<p><strong>Family conflict</strong> — Experienced it at its peak</p>
<p><strong>Writing &amp; documentation</strong> — Did lots of edits on my current website, wrote <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/blog/">posts</a> about education, Indian knowledge system, children&rsquo;s literature, pedagogy and more. Wrote <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a>—sometimes late, sometimes two weeky notes combined, but consistently throughout the whole year.</p>
<p><strong>Discovered <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iktara.shabad/?hl=en">Hardik Dave</a></strong> — His music/singing resonates with me. Attended 2 of his baithaks and Navshakti Garba organized by him.</p>
<p><strong>Reading beyond work</strong> — Finished <em>Electric Train</em>, <em>Mane Fom Chhe</em>, and some parts of 3 more books.</p>
<p><strong>Health journey</strong> — I am at a much better place. We found a naturopathy center in Thaltej which is really good. The treatment worked for me.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship</strong> — Nidhi and I learned a lot during this year in our relationship—moving house, setting up a new house, finding jobs, working on health, facing home conflicts and more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>At <strong>Balgokulam Foundation</strong>, we are trying to make a PBL curriculum for children aged 1.5 to 8 years, rooted in IKS. Right now we are doing research-based pilot projects with existing schools.</p>
<h3 id="what-new-things-i-tried">What New Things I Tried</h3>
<p><strong>Designing a pilot project</strong> for 3 to 6-year-old children on environmental consciousness — From designing pre-tests, activities, writing stories, music, rhymes, procuring puppets, facilitation, to writing observations. Of course it was teamwork, but it was a new thing for me to design a pilot project for a specific research-based curriculum. We also performed one drama for children based on Gijubhai Badheka&rsquo;s story.</p>
<h3 id="collaborations--learning-calls">Collaborations &amp; Learning Calls</h3>
<p><em>Apart from full-time work, I got associated with many projects in small ways. The idea is simple: if our core vision is aligned, we will collaborate in any form.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning calls with <strong>Sanjhe Sapne</strong></li>
<li>Learning calls with Masters students from <strong>Srishti Manipal University</strong></li>
<li>Learning calls with <strong>Project DEFY</strong> team</li>
<li>Learning calls with <strong>Earth Educators Fellows</strong> — Attended the second residency in Coonoor (June 2025)</li>
<li>Collaboration with <strong>Nature Classrooms</strong> for piloting <a href="https://www.natureclassrooms.org/nature-education-assessment-framework">&lsquo;Nature Education Assessment Framework&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>Invited <strong>Nishtha</strong> to take an employee engagement session at Tatvic; Nidhi also co-facilitated</li>
<li><strong>Nishtha and Seemran</strong> put up a stall at Inner Circle garba ground about &lsquo;sexuality and Navratri&rsquo;. Nidhi volunteered. I also went for a night—it was a different experience.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="current-status--way-forward">Current Status &amp; Way Forward</h2>
<p>In 2025, because of family/home conflict, I couldn&rsquo;t focus on many things. I left a few projects which I wanted to do. But it is okay. My priority was different. Now I am at a little more stable place.</p>
<p>I understood that working as an educator in this chaotic world of school systems, NGOs, funding, impact, per-child cost, marketing, classes, programs, curriculum—is difficult. It is a complex system. Now I am comfortable with complexity. I do not have the best solution to deal with it, but I am slowly trying to be okay with it.</p>
<p>I feel jealous/FOMO when I see people&rsquo;s work on LinkedIn, but now I am in a better place.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-okay">It is okay&hellip;</h3>
<p><em>It is okay</em> if I do not want to start my own NGO because I am afraid that I will not be able to raise funds, because I am afraid that my program will not be at par with traditional measurement tools.</p>
<p><em>It is okay</em> if I do not want to start &lsquo;classes&rsquo; or a learning center or take paid workshops where I constantly market myself, where parents look at my practice as a product and themselves as customers.</p>
<p><em>It is okay</em> if I do not belong to any subject or specific age group, because I am afraid that the conventional schooling system will ruin my creativity and experimentality.</p>
<h3 id="questions-im-sitting-with">Questions I&rsquo;m sitting with</h3>
<p><em>Then where do I belong? Where is my tribe? How can I feel that what I am doing is meaningful? How to earn money? How can I find a place where I can stay, work, and make connections with children for a longer time?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-practice-12-years">My Practice (12 Years)</h2>
<p>In the past 12 years, I have developed my practice with children and young adults. I have identified my tools, I have identified themes and learning objectives I want to work with, I have tried different programs/models—for example, residential camps, investigative projects, third spaces for teenagers, and more.</p>
<p><strong>For younger children</strong>, I tried the whole language approach, creative computing, integrated learning, PBL, theater, and more.</p>
<p><strong>After lots of experimentations</strong>, Nidhi and I have developed two programs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nature Detective</strong> — for younger children (theater - storytelling - nature exploration - inquiry-based program)</li>
<li><strong>Local Khoji</strong> — inquiry project-based program</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="two-key-realizations">Two Key Realizations</h2>
<h3 id="1-finding-one-practice-space">1. Finding one practice space</h3>
<p>To be in this game now, I need to find the place where I can do unhindered practice, experimentation, and build authentic relationships with children <strong>+</strong> where I get monetary support to run the home in the city <em>(or find a place in a village and shift there)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="2-butterfly-effect">2. Butterfly Effect</h3>
<p>I believe in the butterfly effect—do small things, contribute to small things continuously. Just like contributing to open-source projects. Without any expectations. Choose a few projects aligned to your ethos and take small steps every day.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am divided into working with two age groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Children aged 3 to 11 years</strong></li>
<li><strong>Young adults aged 12+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One part of my brain is saying that I should pick one age group and deepen my practice in that. But the other part says, <em>it is okay to have multiple working areas, you can still manage</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="next-year-2026">Next Year (2026)</h2>
<h3 id="current-work-sorted-for-1-year">Current Work (Sorted for 1 Year)</h3>
<p>Right now I am working with an organization where we are engaging with children aged 3 to 8 years. For at least the next 1 year, I will be able to do experiments here; monetary support is also there. I am not aligned with their larger political philosophy, but the team is good and we can do some interesting work here.</p>
<h3 id="the-dream-community-space-for-children">The Dream: Community Space for Children</h3>
<p>I am very much interested in theater, storytelling, and children&rsquo;s literature for young children. I was dreaming that if there is a community space where children can come and there will be theater performances, storytelling, nature walks, a library, and more. It is a wish that in my city this type of place must exist where there are no tickets, anyone can come—<strong>not a market-driven initiative</strong>.</p>
<p>People are doing similar work but selling events/workshops or programs for specific classes of people who can afford it. If someone hosts me, I can start a similar place free for all.</p>
<p>This is coming from a place of love and passion for children, theater, and children&rsquo;s literature. I also wish to go to different schools and children&rsquo;s lit festivals as a <strong>traveling theater company</strong>.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if I get some community space or learning center. It is basically our implementation of program - nature detective.</p>
<h3 id="for-young-adults">For Young Adults</h3>
<p>Nidhi and I have developed the Local Khoji program; we tried many other things with this age group. Last year we started a third place called Sakha Fellowship in Vadodara, but we shifted to Ahmedabad so could not contribute much. Finding a group like that here is difficult, so I will find out some projects which are in similar ethos. Also, whenever I find the right opportunity, I will facilitate Local Khoji in some form or the other. Till that time, I will document my experiments well.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborate with organizations that work with youth in innovative ways—filmmaking, investigative projects, civic problem-solving</li>
<li>Run &lsquo;Local Khoji&rsquo; program with selected partners</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I read my friend <a href="https://welearnwegrow.medium.com/reflections-from-2025-and-hello-2026-e4384e74554e">Jaya Ramchandani&rsquo;s reflection</a>. She beautifully explained life long learning spaces.</p>
<p><strong>I want to focus on guided learning and a little bit of self-curated learning spaces this year.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Nidhi is in Kanpur for because of medical emergency at home. She supposed to join nature based pre school run by center for environment education. But now let&rsquo;s see how life takes us..</p>
<hr>
<p>I am really grateful to all my friends, family members and team mate for supporting us in every step of this journey.</p>
