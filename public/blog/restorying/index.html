<content>
  <p>If you ask young people how they feel about insects, many will say:
<strong>“Disgusting.” “I don’t like them.” “They scare me.”</strong></p>
<p>Whether it’s ants, spiders, honeybees, or other small insects, fear and discomfort are common reactions.</p>
<p>Butterflies are the exception.
They are welcomed with wonder and awe — largely because we have labelled them as <em>beautiful</em>.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that this wasn’t always the case.</p>
<p>When children are very young, they often show <strong>no fear or disgust</strong> toward insects or the living world around them. They touch, observe, follow ants, watch spiders, and ask endless questions.
So what changes as they grow up?</p>
<p><strong>Conditioning.</strong></p>
<p>The stories we hear repeatedly shape our beliefs and emotions.
“Bees are dangerous.”
“Ants always bite.”
“All spiders are poisonous.”</p>
<p>Over time, these stories settle into our bodies as fear and avoidance — long before any real experience.</p>
<p>This raises an important question for me as an educator:
<strong>Can we re-story our relationship with insects and the more-than-human world?</strong></p>
<p>In small ways, we are trying.</p>
<p>Recently, I worked with young children on a project where we <em>wrote new stories</em> about ants and spiders. We turned them into musical puppet shows — not to romanticize insects, but to re-introduce them as fellow living beings we can relate to.</p>
<p>We explored insects through:</p>
<ul>
<li>games like insect bingo</li>
<li>magnifying glasses and microscopes</li>
<li>slow observation walks</li>
<li>stories, music, and puppetry</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences gave children the space to reconnect — not through information alone, but through <strong>emotion, curiosity, and relationship</strong>.</p>
<p>Stories are powerful.
They shape how we see the world — and how we treat it.</p>
<p>As an educator, I see my role not just as teaching facts, but as <strong>using stories responsibly — for the larger good</strong>, to nurture care, sensitivity, and a sense of belonging with the living world around us.</p>
<p>Perhaps changing our ecological future begins with changing the stories we tell our children.</p>
