  <p>I have never bought new laptop in my life. I had P4 computer at home around 2008 - 9
After that when I dropped out of school and started working in different organisation, people helped me with their old laptops.</p>
<p>My first laptop was <strong>Asuse eee pc</strong>. I was using it with <strong>Ubuntu &amp; openSUSE</strong> later on..</p>

<p>I remember going to Jigish Bhai&rsquo;s office and making live USB boot for openSUSE Linux distro. That was my first introduction to open source &amp; free software world. My mama Nirmal Pathak is fedora contributor. I remember reading Kartik Bhai&rsquo;s blog about debian &amp; Wikipedia. Doing wikipedia meetup at goraj muni seva ashram.</p>
<p>samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and world of developer :)</p>
<hr>
<p>When I went to dharampur few friends donated 2 - 3 laptops for our school.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba - Vaibhav Pandya</li>
<li>Samsung - Jubin Mehta</li>
<li>Samsung (silver) - Shruti</li>
<li>ASUSE - chirag patel</li>
</ul>
<p>All the laptop were very old, their parts stopped working one by one (like screen, keyboard, battery, etc) accept Samsung (silver) one. When I went to Bhuj one visitor at our school gifted <strong>old macbook air 2013 model</strong>. It was in pretty good condition. I swapped samsung silver with that and started using it.</p>
<p>Since then I am using it as my primary machine. Writing, web browsing, teaching MIT Scratch to children, many other tinkering.. I changed the battery few months ago.</p>

<p>In 2021 Srishti gifted her old macbook air to me. I was using it with children on and off. When Nidhi needed laptop I gave it her. But unfortunately battery of that machine got swelled like balloon. It is difficult to open the body and change it.</p>
<p>Now I gave my macbook air to her and decided to buy new - refurbished laptop.</p>
<p>After some research 2 friends suggested to check out the work of Abhas Abhinav founder of Mostly harmless computers. He is FOSS enthusiast - activist - technologist - hardware hacker - geek. He runs a libretech.shop - a ethical source for libre and liberated hardware products.</p>
<p>I visited his office. It was nostalgia for me to dive in to the world of FOSS again. This time Nidhi was also there. I was happy to introduce her to this philosophy..</p>
<p><strong>Abhas bhai gifted me a book called &lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo; which is in my reading list.</strong></p>

<p><strong>he also gifted mostlly harmless USB dive with around 13 type of linux distro</strong></p>

<p>From his recommendation I met Ved who runs refurbished laptop shop in banaswadi.
After so much of comparing and testing I finally bought refurbished Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Gen (Intel i7 8th Gen, 16GB RAM, 512 HDD)</p>

<h3 id="my-criteria-was">My criteria was</h3>
<ul>
<li>repairablity</li>
<li>possiblity to upgrade (RAM, CPU)</li>
<li>portabilty (light weight)</li>
<li>feature proof</li>
<li>compatable with linux / free bios</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinkpad X1C is not true for all criteria. Number 1 yes, 2 no , 3 big yes, 4 yes, 5 yes - linux can run very nicely but the bios is not free you can&rsquo;t do core boot. You can&rsquo;t upgrade RAM. But solution I am thinking is after 5 - 6 years of usage I can again sell it to refurbished shop and upgrade the machine.</p>
<p>Tjesh GN, Aditya, Kartik bhai, Nirmal bhai and Suchakra helped a lot take the disison. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>So <strong>welcome to family - Thinkpad X1 Carbon - 2nd March 2024</strong></p>
<p>During this process I read a lot about FOSS and again visited <a href="kartikm.wordpress.com">Kartik bhai</a> &amp; <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">Thejesh&rsquo;s blog</a>. I amazed with the power of community in FOSS and really wish to see that in education sector.</p>
