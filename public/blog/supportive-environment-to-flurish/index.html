  <p>It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain? People who have empty cars are offering seats to others. If we create such an app, car owners will know who else needs a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but these types of apps are already there, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m talking about a local app.
Another great idea was an app for men&rsquo;s customized clothes. But madam wouldn’t even listen to it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also suggested a game idea, and she did the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s stop judging these students&rsquo; ideas and talk about their college teacher instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of listening to the students&rsquo; ideas and giving constructive feedback, she directly rejects them, saying it’s not possible.</li>
<li>She insults students in class in front of everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior crushes the self-esteem and confidence of the students. We need teachers who allow young people to share new ideas freely. When they receive support without fear, their creativity can flourish. Remember these young people are entrepreneur of tomorrow</p>
