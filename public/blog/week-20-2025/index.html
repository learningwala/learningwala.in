  <h4 id="12th-may-to-18th-may-2025-monday-to-sunday">12th May to 18th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>This week was Happy Week. I tried enjoying each and every day as it came.
Not getting time to write my weekly note on Sunday and finishing it on Monday is getting difficult. I want to write in detail but I&rsquo;m not getting the mental space.</p>
<p>I got a new laptop from the office - a ThinkPad E16.
It is heavy, runs Windows, has a big screen,
and battery backup is good.</p>
<p>The first few days I was not ready to leave my Carbon and shift to this because of my set workflow. But according to office policy, I needed to, so finally I moved.</p>
<p>My Carbon is giving me little problems nowadays. The venting system in X series is not that great. In Ahmedabad&rsquo;s heat, the fan of my machine is going mad. On the other side, the E16 is working smoothly.</p>
<p>I asked a few friends - they said there must be dust in the fan which needs to be cleaned, and I should avoid tasks with high CPU usage. I will clean it and see.</p>
<hr>
<p>From Monday to Wednesday, we had a storytelling workshop by Vikram Sridhar at our office.
On Tuesday, we went to The Calico Museum of Textiles as part of the workshop.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad is called a &lsquo;World Heritage City&rsquo; and it has 30+ museums. I never saw this city through a heritage lens.But now both Nidhi and I have decided to see this city through this lens. We want to start by going on heritage walks, visiting museums, and being part of the theater culture here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tuesday we watched a film called &lsquo;Bangalore Days.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a nice, fun film in Malayalam. We watched it with subtitles. Nidhi recommended this film; she watched it a few years ago and she really liked it.</p>
<p>We also finished the film &lsquo;Angoor,&rsquo; which we had started watching earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summer break at school, so our canteen is closed. That means I need to prepare food at home and take a lunch box. For me, waking up early and making food is difficult. Same with Nidhi. I can do reading, writing, and other kinds of work in the morning, but not cooking. Nidhi is helping so much with cooking lunch and breakfast. Slowly, I have also started making breakfast. So now in the morning, we both are stretching ourselves and preparing food.</p>
<p>Nidhi is also experimenting with dinner and snacks. She loves cooking and experimenting with food. She&rsquo;s basically a foodie. I am cognitively very interested in food but slowly getting interested in the hands-on part of it - I mean cooking. For me, it&rsquo;s a long way to go. I know basic cooking like making khichadi, sabji, dal-chawal&hellip; I need to learn roti. Most importantly, I need to learn how to use the kitchen neatly.</p>
<p>Apart from this, we both want to constantly work on our diet because of our sensitive stomachs. Especially my stomach, which is very sensitive. The doctor told me that it&rsquo;s like the stomach of a 6-year-old. So we both need to remind ourselves to eat at home and eat millets, fruits,things with less masala.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday, we started watching a web series called &lsquo;Very Parivarik&rsquo; by TVF. It is a very relatable show.</p>
<p>On the same day, we had a long conversation about spending quality time with each other. For both of us, quality time means different things. Example : For Nidhi, it&rsquo;s cooking together, and for me, it&rsquo;s discussing ideas/brainstorming together. So we made a list of things and shared with each other. We also made a kind of timetable to fit everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>We went to Aarambh Cafe on Saturday evening. I was craving good sambar. Actually, Kamla Cafe, Aarambh Cafe, Kasturba Cafe, Atithi Restaurant, and Thepla Sabji from Gajanand - these are places that serve food which we can eat without worrying about our stomachs.</p>

<p><strong>We discussed Khojbeen Mandali activities. Some updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of our friends from Eklavya Foundation, Melody, wrote an article on &lsquo;Development of Aesthetic Sense in Primary Grades Through Nature-Based Activities&rsquo; which got published in a journal by Azim Premji University. I was part of this project, creating activities and mentoring the facilitator. Now we are planning to publish this work in other magazines like Sandarbh, Vikalp Sangam, and Nature Classrooms blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Nature Classrooms book &lsquo;There Is Nothing There,&rsquo; which Nidhi translated into Hindi, we are collaborating with Eklavya Foundation to print it in Hindi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are inviting Tanaya from Nature Classrooms to come to Ahmedabad. She will be observing pilots about nature education assessment tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are conducting a local Khoji film-making camp this coming weekend (23rd to 25th May)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tried developing a logo and visual identity for Khojbeen Mandali with a few friends. We gained some clarity about what we want during the process. We&rsquo;re going with what I made initially. One more friend is helping to make it better. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll get something interesting in the next few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coonoor trip for Earth Educator Workshop. (28th May to 3rd June 2025)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Sunday we went to Vikram Sridhar&rsquo;s storytelling performance at Scrap Yard. We enjoyed driving the Activa at night on surprisingly less trafficked roads.</p>
<p>I spent time coordinating with the team for the local Khoji camp.</p>
<p>I started reading again but am not getting uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good week.</p>
