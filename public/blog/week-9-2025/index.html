  <h4 id="22nd-to-28th-feb-2025-saturday-to-friday">22nd to 28th Feb 2025 (Saturday to Friday)</h4>
<p>This week was super busy. Most days, we were out. We are newlyweds, so family and friends are inviting us for lunch and dinner at their place. We enjoy going to friends&rsquo; places, but at relatives&rsquo; places, Nidhi needs to be ready in a saree or kurta with ornaments and all. She doesn&rsquo;t like it, so it was tough for her.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 22nd Feb: we went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s place. We enjoyed chatting with Mitali Ben&rsquo;s mom and Jagat Bhai. It&rsquo;s a family.. every minute cracking jokes happens.. very light environment, cricket, movies, puns, and more. I wish my family become like this. It gives you mental peace that everything is ok, we will handle it. At my place, it was like war was happening, strict, silent, needful talk only..anyway..</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>On 25th Feb: we went to Anushree&rsquo;s place to have lunch. Anushree is a new friend from Vadodra. She contacted me for her research on karma &amp; shradha. Me &amp; Nidhi both participated in the research.. and became good friends.</p>
<p>She is from a Marathi family living in Vadodara. We enjoyed talking to her ajji and visiting her small garden in the compound. She is an upcycling expert, she made many interesting things for trash.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>On 26th Feb: on Shivaratri, Nidhi and mummy-papa visited our community temple in the Narmada district called Nandikeshwar Mahadev. The roads were very bad and it was 3hrs journey. Everyone was tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we visited my mama&rsquo;s place for dinner (we visited 3 relative&rsquo;s places in one day.. it was overwhelming)</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>In between all these we did packing for our next move. One day mummy also came and helped us. It was very very helpful. It could take a longer time for me and Nidhi if she didn&rsquo;t come.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>28th Feb: I &amp; Nidhi finally moved to Ahmedabad on Friday. Ravi Bhai offered us his flat to use for some time. So we can find a proper place to live. Finding a house in a big cities is a tough job. We both are very greatful to him.
Nidhi doesn&rsquo;t like flats/apartments, she likes old-style houses with open spaces, gardens, and all. I also like those but it&rsquo;s a luxury in the city.</p>
<p>Now a new journey is starting, finding a home, finding a workplace for Nidhi, finding healthy food options (we both have stomach issues) finding a cook, setting up stuff in a home, and transport options.. should we buy a scooter or not.. many actions are in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After reaching Ahmedabad. First setup after reaching to Ahmedabad  :</p>
