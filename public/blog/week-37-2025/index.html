  <h4 id="8th-to-14-sep-2025-monday-to-sunday">8th to 14 Sep 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p><strong>Mon - Fri:</strong> Office work mostly. There is chaos going on at the office because of some management level changes. It&rsquo;s an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and less clarity. Let&rsquo;s hope for the best.</p>
<p>We have almost finished the pre-test with children. From 17th Sep, we will start our actual pilot session with children. I am super excited for that. I got the opportunity to design the pre-test, activities, and facilitation - all parts of the pilot. I am very grateful for that. I am looking forward to each and every session.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> We had a wonderful counseling session with N. She gave very interesting activities to do throughout the week. That conversation gave me hope and clarity to walk on the path of togetherness more strongly and joyfully.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> I was not feeling well. Body pain and restlessness were there. I took a break, I dropped my to-dos and rested a bit. In the evening, we went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafe_padmanabham/?hl=en">Cafe Padmanabham</a>. I skipped my diet and made it a cheat day. After that, we went to a friend&rsquo;s place and had a chat till late night.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> We visited Haveli Temple, I really like the aesthetics and music over there</p>
<p>then went to Smart Bazaar for some grocery shopping with my friend (D), and had dinner at Radhe Dhokla. I realized that I hate shopping at big stores with multiple options. I need something simple where I just put in my list and get home delivery at the lowest price. I don&rsquo;t want to spend time comparing prices, and it&rsquo;s difficult to control yourself when there are too many cute things around catching your eye&hellip; anyway, I enjoyed the outing.</p>
<p>Nidhi wanted to explore more, but I dragged her home so I could sleep early and continue my morning routine. But still, we slept very late&hellip; that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="updates">Updates:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi restarted sessions at learning center. She took session on thrusday.</li>
<li>Our cook didi left the work because the timing was not matching. She found another cook didi for us. Let&rsquo;s see how this journey goes.</li>
<li>My office laptop is back with screen replacement. So now I am writing this note from the bedroom. It is repaired, but still there are some issues with the trackpad, and sometimes it gets restarted automatically. I need to notify them.</li>
<li>Dear friend <a href="https://adhavansivaraj.xyz/">Adhavan Sivaraj</a> shared about the courses/programs offered by his org <a href="https://livinglabs.institute/">livinglabs</a>. Really impressive work they are doing.</li>
<li>Nidhi&rsquo;s birthday is coming up on the 16th. I am excited for that.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to sessions with children. I need to make myself ready.</li>
<li>Yoga and other health-related stuff is going well. I will continue tracking those things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="media">Media:</h2>
<p>On Sunday, I was reading about Indian philosophies on a <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/wiki/indian-philosophies/">page</a> shared by Thej. I got an urge to listen to the title track of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ek_Khoj">&lsquo;Bharat Ek Khoj&rsquo;</a>. We discussed the title track, after that we watched the first episode. We went on to listen to the title track of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ki_Chhap">&lsquo;Bharat Ki Chhap&rsquo;</a>&hellip; then somehow we landed up watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishad_Ganga">&lsquo;Upanishad Ganga&rsquo;</a> and watched two episodes of that. It was an interesting rollercoaster ride.</p>
<p>Nidhi shared that she wants to learn more about Indian philosophy and history. I was thinking we can convince Mahendra sir to take a course on Indian philosophy and write to Subbu (CN Subramaniam) for taking something on history. This would be a wonderful learning journey if we make it possible.</p>
