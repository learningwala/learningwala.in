<content>
  <p>After 13 years in education—working directly with children, leading workshops and summer camps, teaching subjects, training teachers, developing curricula, conducting research, and managing large-scale implementations—I&rsquo;ve developed a framework for choosing where I invest my time and energy.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-do-what-i-do">Why I Do What I Do</h2>
<p>At the core, <strong>Remaining inwardly light and free matters more to me than any role, outcome, or achievement.</strong></p>
<p>What draws me to education:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being with children and young adults</li>
<li>Creative mediums: writing, filmmaking, theater, nature exploration</li>
<li>Exploring how education can be a tool for living conflict-free</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-four-criteria-for-full-time-work">The Four Criteria for Full-Time Work</h2>
<h3 id="1-ethos">1. Ethos</h3>
<p>My educational philosophy centers on:</p>
<p><strong>For young children:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nature exploration</li>
<li>Theater</li>
<li>Project-based learning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For young adults:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Self-directed learning</li>
<li>Third spaces</li>
<li>Citizen science</li>
<li>Projects</li>
<li>Socio-emotional learning and life skills</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-money">2. Money</h3>
<p>One place that provides financial stability—enough to save and survive in the city.</p>
<h3 id="3-practice-ground">3. Practice Ground</h3>
<p>A place where I can engage in direct, daily work with children to try my ideas and document them. This becomes an outlet for pedagogical experiments, new children&rsquo;s literature, theater, research papers. If not direct contact with children, then close work with a group of educators or a team—some form of direct engagement where I can impact, experiment, and make meaning.</p>
<h3 id="4-bonus-considerations">4. Bonus Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Team, organizational culture, and history</li>
<li>Proximity to hometown</li>
<li>Cost of living in the city</li>
<li>Likelihood of finding friends and a like-minded community</li>
<li>Long-term growth opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-compromise-im-willing-to-make">The Compromise I&rsquo;m Willing to Make</h2>
<p>Finding work that checks all four boxes is difficult. I&rsquo;ve learned to be pragmatic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now okay working on large-scale projects, even those that aren&rsquo;t making deep impact or aren&rsquo;t fully aligned with my educational philosophy—if there&rsquo;s good money, direct work with children, and some elements of my ethos present. I&rsquo;m open to private schools or large-scale CSR projects if certain checkboxes are ticked. I&rsquo;ll do whatever I can within my capacity in that project.</p>
<p>Essentially: <strong>I&rsquo;m willing to compromise on criteria 1 and 4 if criteria 2 and 3 are there.</strong></p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t fixed. The weight I give each criterion shifts with life circumstances. Right now, proximity to a specific city matters because of certain personal commitments that require me to be in that location. Similarly, if I&rsquo;m at a point where I urgently need to save money—perhaps for a family need, health emergency, or to build a financial cushion—money becomes the primary driver, and I might compromise more on ethos or practice ground.</p>
<p>The decision always emerges from the interplay of these four factors, weighted by what life demands at that moment. When I do find work that aligns with my ethos, provides financial stability, and offers a daily practice ground, I gain the bandwidth to invest my remaining time and energy elsewhere—in what I call &ldquo;butterfly effect work.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="side-projects-the-butterfly-effect-and-why-it-matters">Side Projects: The Butterfly Effect and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>The butterfly effect, borrowed from chaos theory, suggests that small actions in complex systems can have large, unpredictable consequences. A butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world might eventually contribute to a tornado forming elsewhere. In education, I think of this as ecosystem work—small, intentional acts that ripple outward in ways we cannot fully foresee or control.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-type-of-work-matters">Why This Type of Work Matters</h3>
<p>Education isn&rsquo;t a linear system where inputs guarantee outputs. It&rsquo;s a living, breathing ecosystem of learners, educators, ideas, contexts, and cultures. Real transformation doesn&rsquo;t happen through single interventions or top-down mandates. It emerges from many people making small contributions—sharing ideas, creating resources, experimenting with practices, documenting learnings—that others can pick up, adapt, and build upon.</p>
<p>I chose to do this type of project because I want to learn curriculum design. Volunteering and being part of the curriculum design process will give me hands-on experience, allowing me to refine my skills accordingly. This is how I build my portfolio and network. This is a very important parameter to consider when choosing side projects: What is your long-term strategy? Are your side projects aligned with your personal brand? Which topics, skills, or areas do you want to explore in the future? Ultimately, it should be based on your career curiosity and growth needs.</p>
<h3 id="my-side-projects-as-ecosystem-investments">My Side Projects as Ecosystem Investments</h3>
<p>Since my full-time work doesn&rsquo;t always leave room to volunteer directly with children, I now select side projects with broader network impact—work that strengthens the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Gujarati Children&rsquo;s Magazine:</strong>
I&rsquo;m helping curate, design, and publish a children&rsquo;s magazine in Gujarati—writing stories and poems, coordinating with illustrators, finding grants. This is my contribution to Gujarati children&rsquo;s literature. The magazine reaches educators, children, parents, libraries, schools, and learning centers. Other contributors join, it becomes a movement. Like open-source software, each person adds something, and the whole becomes richer than any individual could create alone.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation and Publishing:</strong>
I&rsquo;m documenting past projects around experiential learning, nature education, and other work. We&rsquo;ll publish these as zines, online articles, and printed versions—playbooks that other educators can implement in their own contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Calls:</strong>
I&rsquo;m doing regular learning calls with different organizations that share similar ethos. If your organization is developing curriculum for young adults and I can contribute something, we have conversations where I share insights and learnings from my 13 years of practice.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t consulting relationships where I&rsquo;m the expert dispensing wisdom. They&rsquo;re generative dialogues where ideas cross-pollinate. Someone shares a challenge they&rsquo;re facing, I share what I&rsquo;ve tried, they take it somewhere new, and suddenly we&rsquo;ve both learned something neither of us would have discovered alone.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is all volunteer work—contributions to the ecosystem, investments in the butterfly effect. Small, unpredictable acts that ripple outward in ways we cannot foresee. While my full-time work might involve compromises for money or circumstances, these side projects keep me tethered to what matters most: creating the conditions for others to learn, experiment, and grow freely.</p>
<h2 id="the-shifting-balance">The Shifting Balance</h2>
<p>This matrix helps me navigate a sector where idealism and pragmatism must coexist. The four criteria remain constant, but their weight shifts with life. Sometimes location matters most. Sometimes it&rsquo;s urgent financial need. Sometimes a rare practice ground opportunity appears that&rsquo;s worth taking a pay cut for.</p>
<p>The framework doesn&rsquo;t give me easy answers, but it gives me clarity about what I&rsquo;m choosing and why. It allows me to maintain inner spaciousness and freedom while meeting the practical needs of survival, impact, and growth. And it ensures that even when I&rsquo;m compromising in one area, I&rsquo;m finding ways to contribute meaningfully in others—trusting that small acts, generously offered, will ripple outward in ways I cannot predict but can deeply believe in.</p>
