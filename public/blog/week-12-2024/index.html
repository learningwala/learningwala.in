  <h3 id="developing-my-personal-website">Developing my personal website</h3>
<p>This week I spend lots of time in making - remaking - fixing and adding content to my personal website using hugo server and github pages. I learnt that text editer is importnat part of coding process. first I used sublime text and because of that hugo server was giving some error. I shifted to ubuntu defult text editor and somehow I managed to work. From last few days ubuntu was giving some glitchs on my laptop. specificly about sound and bluetooth. Sound was not coming and bluetooth was not connecting to my boat blootooth speaker. I tried different driver and fixing stuff using ubuntu forums and other websites but no sucess. Finally I re installed ubuntu. Before that I tried using and lots of reading about Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora.. I installed Pop OS but not satisfied with it, tried Manjaro but I didn&rsquo;t like KDE. Finally I came back to ubuntu 22. During this process of making website I reserched a lot about :</p>
<ul>
<li>static site genrator like hugo, pelican and more</li>
<li>Minimal - indie web blogging platform</li>
<li>Personal wiki and note taking tool</li>
<li>linux distro like manjaro, arch linux</li>
<li>How to use dynamic page and CMS in wix.com</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhxznWkXYAAsJch?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="linux distro"></p>
<p>I know these all are rabbit holes, i spent qite a lot of time to read hackernews this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t spend much time on instagram or other social media.</li>
<li>I am happy that I learnt to make website using hugo and github pages.  I wanted to use hugo-bearcub theme but it is giving some error. Currently I am using hugo-bearblog theme</li>
<li>making your personal wiki using <a href="http://simplenote.com/">&lsquo;simple note&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>I refreshed my knowldge about git , markdown and basic terminal code</li>
<li>last week I have read few pages from book called <a href="https://public.resource.org/swaraj/">&lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg" alt="Aaron "></p>
<p>that lead me to watching <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s</a>  documetry called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo;s own boy&rsquo;. Yes I know I discovered it very late but I was amazed by watching it. it is very very thought provoking. After watching documentry I spent quite a lot of time reading about open data work of <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">thejesh GN</a> and other people. <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta</a> is also doing wonderful work of putting educational / children litreture in public domain through his website and using internet archive.  I was feeling so happy when I got to know that Aaron contributed in making of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">&lsquo;Markdown&rsquo;</a> and I am using it right now :)</p>
