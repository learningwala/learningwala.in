<p>I took off from the office Monday to Wednesday. It helped me a lot to stabilize myself and somewhat handle the situation while taking care of myself. I am very grateful to my team for being supportive.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="khojbeen-mandali-update">Khojbeen Mandali Update:</h4>
<p>I went to Nidhi&rsquo;s learning center on Tuesday evening. We are still doing pre-tests with children. Hopefully, we will start the intervention from next week.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mahendra sir was in town for two days. He called and we met for dinner on Wednesday. It was nice as usual—discussions about educational philosophy, teacher education, and life in general. He introduced us to a nice South Indian restaurant near Gujarat Vidyapith.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thursday : We went to see &lsquo;Metro in Dino&hellip;&rsquo;. I liked the movie.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Friday evening, office colleagues made a spontaneous plan and came home. We had chai, ghughra, and made a nice dinner—dal chawal, began sabji&hellip;</p>
<p>It was really nice to forget everything and be with friends, enjoying the moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday was busy with a workshop/course I&rsquo;m attending from the office on &lsquo;Indian Aesthetics&rsquo;. Slowly, I&rsquo;m starting to get the hang of it. I&rsquo;m able to make connections. I used to have these types of discussions with Mahendra sir. I want to deep dive into this and do something tangible with it in the classroom with children.</p>
<hr>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been part of formal college education, so I&rsquo;ve felt the need over the years to find learning opportunities beyond professional, outcome-driven roles. I long for a phase where I can simply be a student again. I wish to take a break from my full-time job for 2-3 months. During that time, I want to do something (facilitation/assisting someone in writing a research paper) around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of environmental aesthetic sense in children, especially from an Indic perspective</li>
<li>Exploration of the affective domain, connecting it with Rasa theory</li>
<li>Project-based and integrated learning approaches</li>
<li>Something related to neuroscience, environment and aesthetics</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me manifest it. If you are reading this and know someone related to this, please connect me.</p>
<p>On one side, I&rsquo;m interested in working with older children/teenagers through projects, helping to develop self-directed learning spaces. On the other side, I like working with younger children on the topics mentioned above.</p>
<p>I need to think about the long term—what will be useful for making my career more sustainable. This is a very capitalistic thought&hellip; where I have fear about my career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to choose paths without any fear when you&rsquo;re married, in your 30s, when the world is moving at super-fast speed. I have an understanding partner; we&rsquo;re ready to support each other, but still&hellip; I never thought this way when I was alone, but now it&rsquo;s by default.</p>
<p>I just started earning some money after so many years, and suddenly I want to take a break to pursue a deeper learning journey. There should be some support system for these types of sabbaticals&hellip;</p>
<p>I just remembered that I never take intentional vacations or travel without any agenda since I&rsquo;ve been working. From age 18, I&rsquo;ve been constantly working—job after job, place after place—proving myself, working with children, teachers and organizations, learning new things, trying to establish myself in this fast-moving world.</p>
<p>I want to use the break to just be&hellip; without any agenda&hellip; heal myself&hellip; love myself more.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Sunday, we went to Vadodara. I facilitated a creative writing workshop with Sakha fellows. It was a super hectic day. We started at 9:30 in the morning and came back around the same time at night. We spent almost 6 hours traveling for a 3-hour workshop. But we enjoyed spending time with young people, exploring poetry and other forms of writing with them. I will write a separate post about the same.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to stay back in Vadodara to rest and come back the next day.</p>
<hr>
<p>This week I said no to one freelance project. It was related to developing modules around climate action mindset and career paths for middle school children. It was an interesting subject, but right now I don&rsquo;t have the time or mental stability to sit and work on this project along with my full-time job. Nidhi is also busy with other projects. I am very grateful to the people for trusting and supporting me for this.</p>
<hr>
<p>A friend and I are working on experiential learning / game-based workshops with corporate employees. It&rsquo;s new for me. I&rsquo;m learning how to facilitate Gen Z employees through games :)</p>
<hr>
<p>What else? I&rsquo;m trying to stabilize myself. Finding my grounding&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to travel anywhere this month. I want to be at home, go to the office regularly, focus on a few things.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to the therapist after the first session. I&rsquo;m rethinking the same—should I go or not? I want to find alternative ways to heal myself.</p>
<p>Things will get better&hellip;</p>
<p>धीरे-धीरे रे मना, धीरे सब कुछ होय । माली सींचे सौ घड़ा, ऋतु आए फल होय ॥</p>
<p>I wanted to write this weekly note in Gujarati but I restricted myself, because many friends/readers are not from Gujarat. I don&rsquo;t want to trust Google Translate for my Gujarati :) but I will definitely start writing other posts in Gujarati soon.</p>

Mom is with us. My mental health is at its worst. I am taking a break from office work (still doing other side projects slowly) and working on my self. This family matter is taking too much out of me. Not able to focus on any projects/work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-july-to-13th-july-2025-monday-to-sunday">7th July to 13th July 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>The first half of the week went mostly in office work.</p>
<p>I have visited Vadodara for a family matter. Mom is with us. My mental health is at its worst. I am taking a break from office work (still doing other side projects slowly) and working on my self. This family matter is taking too much out of me. Not able to focus on any projects/work.</p>
<p>It is ok, it is a phase. It will also pass. I wish friends could come to visit us. I am feeling very alone. We, me and Nidhi both need support.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, have the luxury to work from home/take leave from work. Please do come to visit us in Ahmedabad. Spend time with us without any agenda.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am very proud of myself that I am committed to weekly notes. Week by week documenting the journey, reflecting&hellip; just putting out words there also gives me relief&hellip; this is my medium of sharing&hellip; sharing a piece of life. Sometimes it puts me in trouble also when I put some sensitive info out there but it is ok. I am learning. I don&rsquo;t want to censor so much. I read Divya&rsquo;s weekly note. The way she expresses gives me hope.</p>
<p>Thejesh shared some very interesting stuff about &lsquo;weekly notes&rsquo; in his latest weekly note which I liked so much. So sharing here again :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blog post by James - <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write">&ldquo;More People should write&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excerpt from the book <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674057579">&ldquo;Field Notes on Science and Nature.&rdquo;</a> which describes the nature of weekly notes:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking time to write out an idea or observation forces us to pause and consider. Recording the daily unfolding of experiments—their success or failure—encourages an honest assessment of how each day&rsquo;s work fits within the underlying goals and theory of the project. It takes time to create a narrative of experiments, events, and observations, but it eventually pays dividends because it forces thorough examination, which is a common characteristic of science across disciplines. In Darwin&rsquo;s description of the marine iguana, for example, we can imagine him on board the Beagle, penning his zoological notes and pondering the origin of their &ldquo;apparent stupidity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Resources on nature journaling:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://johnmuirlaws.com/journaling-curriculum/">How to teach nature Journaling</a>
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/clare-walker-leslie/keeping-a-nature-journal-3rd-edition/9781635862294/">Keeping a natural Journal</a></p>
<p>I will write my experience with nature journaling and teaching natural journaling to educators and children in a separate post.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wanted to build a social media feed kind of page on my blog for a long time. Just like Twitter feed with short text or image. I saw an example of that on <a href="https://sylvia.bearblog.dev/status/">Sylvia&rsquo;s website</a> and tried making it for my Hugo site with the help of ChatGPT. Finally made the basic version which I like. I will share the link after I put something on it. I will also try to create a different RSS feed for that.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me tell you this, do you know some people go to their favorite shows/books/places when they are low or stressed. I go to my favorite blogs/weekly notes. Specially <a href="https://thejeshgn.com">Thej&rsquo;s blog</a> and <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik bhai&rsquo;s blog</a>. I read old posts. At Kartik bhai&rsquo;s blog I read his reports about DebConf or other FOSS conf/meetups (Wikipedia, OSM, blogger community). It is very refreshing for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday &amp; Sunday was little happening. I had a call with Sanjhe Sapne team, mentoring call with Earth Educator fellow, and I attended one office work related online workshop.</p>
<p>Sunday I met dear friend Malay after few months. We talked about many interesting topics.
One thing I shared with him was the disappearing of open source/FOSS communities. Few years ago there were communities of Wikipedians, OSM people, bloggers, Linux meetups&hellip; nowadays there are very few meetups in cities like Ahmedabad and Vadodara. Nowadays I see meetups around AI and AWS :) which is ok&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know I like more of the old stuff :)</p>
<hr>
<p>I need to prepare myself for working with children. Need to do some robust planning, some theater activities for self to get into the zone&hellip; I need to leave these screens and be more with myself.</p>
<hr>
<p>I started reading again, very slowly I am picking up&hellip; finished last few chapters of the book called &lsquo;Electric Train&rsquo;. I am going to pick the book called &lsquo;Rakhdu no kagad&rsquo; (which I already read in the past) again. Going back to familiar things&hellip; this is the phase right now.</p>

<h4 id="health">Health</h4>
<p>This week was difficult. My mental health is in a very bad phase.
Over the last few months, I somehow managed, but now it’s hitting me hard. I’m not able to concentrate on work.
Feeling anxious, being zoned out, sleep cycle disturbed. I’m feeling that everything is meaningless.
I’ve started therapy. Let’s see how it goes. It’s costly, but at this point in time, I want to invest in my health.
I am very grateful for Nidhi&rsquo;s support.</p>
<p>We bought health supplements for both of us long back, but haven’t started taking them yet.
Yesterday, Nidhi made a nice poster with the timings and names of the supplements.
So… let’s begin!</p>

<p>I want do yoga regularly, wish me luck !!</p>
<p>Nidhi has been unwell for the last few days. Stomach pain — maybe because of outside food in this weather. She’s better today.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="personal-website">Personal Website</h4>
<p>I’ve made some changes to my website hosting setup. I started with a GitHub repo + GitHub Pages, where I edited my files on my local machine, built the Hugo site, and pushed it to the Git repo. It got published on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Cloudflare Pages, where I edited and built the Hugo site and pushed the public folder to CF Pages.</p>
<p>I have different machines at the office and at home. In the CF Pages setup, I wasn’t able to edit my site during my office chai breaks.
Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t want to wait until I sit at my personal laptop to publish them. So I went back to GitHub.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve put all my content files on the Git repo, and CF Pages builds the Hugo site automatically. Now I can edit my files on the Git repo from the browser.
I tried using Git through the command line, but my office laptop is Windows, so it was difficult. It didn’t even understand some file names — some error came because of that.
WSL is not allowed to download, so finally, the browser was my saviour.</p>
<p>I was concerned about the repo size because I publish images in every weekly note.
I’m using Hugo’s image optimization shortcode which converts images into WebP, resizes them, and makes them responsive — so I’m hopeful.</p>
<p>In short, now I can log in to GitHub and edit my site (very basic functions like adding a new post or editing an existing post).</p>
<p>btw I have added small little black dot as favicon :)</p>

<p>Jitu (one of the members from our Sakha community) visited us on Friday. He studies Electronics and Communication at LD Engineering College, Ahmedabad. We talked about AI, programming, life, nature, climate change, and what not… We had nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXKNCSkVweU">Jamnagri Ghughra</a> near our home and took a lovely walk at Eklavya Sports Campus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jamnagari Ghughra is a savory, fried pastry from Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, featuring a spicy potato and pea filling. It&rsquo;s a popular street food, often enjoyed with spicy and sweet chutneys. The dish is known for its crispy outer layer and flavorful stuffing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nidhi made wonderful dhokli today… it reminded me of mom.
(Dhokli is a traditional Gujarati dish — wheat flour dumplings simmered in a tangy, spiced lentil curry. Comfort food at its best.)</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="23rd-june-to-29th-june-2025-monday-to-sunday">23rd June to 29th June 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>We watched <em>Sitare Zameen Par</em> on Monday. It was a nice film. I just wish the narrative had been a little subtler—it felt too direct for me. But still, it&rsquo;s a really important subject that needs to be talked about in mass media.</p>
<p>For the first time, I tried kneading roti dough—with Nidhi’s help. I wasn’t confident at all, but somehow, I managed. I want to explore this more. This week Nidhi made some awesome pasta and experimental bharva taroi sabji :)</p>
<p>On Friday, we facilitated a session on <em>Nature-Based Learning</em> with research and curriculum team at my office. We both enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Saturday evening, we went to Priti Ben’s place. It was rainy, but we enjoyed the metro ride.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we visited a nearby sports campus called <em>Eklavya Sports Academy</em>. It’s a lush green space. We went for a morning walk for the first time. As expected, Nidhi got completely engaged in observing trees and greenery—she was more interested in looking at trees than walking! But still, we managed a nice 3–4 rounds of walking. After that, we went to <em>DVG Benne Dosa</em>. The food was nice but a little pricey. We had ghee masala dosa and palak paddu. We always look for good, authentic South Indian places. After living in Bangalore, we can’t eat dosa at just any regular place. In Gujarat, dosa and sambar are something else altogether. I want to make a list of places in Ahmedabad where you can eat good dosa.</p>
<p>In the evening, we watched a Malayalam film called <em>Hridayam</em>. It was a beautiful film, though it felt a bit long—it runs for 2 hours and 51 minutes.</p>
<p>This week, I also listened to some old Gujarati songs and watched Marathi short film.</p>
<p>This weekend, we had a negotiation around time. Nidhi wanted to spend more time with me, while I wanted some alone time. We somehow figured out a temporary middle path.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I’ve been daydreaming about something strange—I’m dreaming of getting admission into a university. I’ve never been a full-time student at a college or university. I started working when I was 19. Now, I feel this strong craving to live as a student—without tension, experimenting and researching new ideas&hellip; a curiosity-driven life.</p>
<p>I’ve been re-reading the PhD thesis of <a href="https://1derful.org/">Jay Silver</a>(Makey Makey, MIT Media Lab) and wondering if I could also write something about the <em>learning experiments</em> I’ve done with children and teachers over the past 12 years. How my philosophy of education and life has changed. How my understanding of learning has evolved. I want to document and reflect on all my past projects.</p>
<p>Academia scares me with its rigidity, but these days I’m thinking more about independent research—something related to nature education, experiential learning&hellip;is there something like a <em>practicing PhD</em>?</p>
<p>Sometimes, I also feel like doing something entirely different from education. I feel saturated. At times I think I should move into the livelihoods sector or ecological restoration—maybe work with farmers&hellip;</p>
<p>Or maybe I should take a break and just focus on writing, doing theater, learning music, studying design, aesthetics and philosophy —something for the soul. Not for money. Not to prove anything.</p>
<p>My relationship with money is also changing radically. Now, I spend without overthinking. I don’t ask whether something is expensive—I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it useful?</li>
<li>Is it solving a real problem?</li>
<li>Is it sustainably made?</li>
<li>Is it an impulsive buy, or something I truly need?</li>
<li>Even if it’s impulsive, is it eco-friendly or socially just?</li>
<li>Do I want to support this kind of business?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if I’m buying a pair of chappals made from sustainable materials, designed well, and if the brand promotes justice—and if I can afford it—I won’t obsess over the cost. I mean, I won’t judge it <em>only</em> by the price.</p>
<p>Even with all this reflection, I’m still in a grey zone. I’m not very clear about my relationship with money right now. From childhood, we’re taught to save, to not spend much on things or experiences. But once you start earning, once you live in a city, your relationship with money shifts.</p>
<p>What if I want to eat 200 benne dosas in Ahmedabad? I’ll buy them. Food should be good. Living spaces should be good. Spend money on books, travel, meeting people, hosting friends, sending gifts&hellip; doing experiments&hellip; everything that nourishes your soul.</p>
<p>My mental health hasn’t been great. I’ll seek help soon.
My back pain has returned—possibly due to driving and sitting too much. I need to start exercising again and using a hot bag.</p>

<p>This week was not very hectic, but not too slow either. Overall, it was a good week, work-wise.
On Monday and Tuesday, we spent time with the Nature Classroom team.</p>
<p>Nidhi visited Mumbai to facilitate a workshop. She felt very confident while facilitating the session and really enjoyed it. I felt so happy seeing her journey as a facilitator/educator. I’m so grateful to be a small part of her journey, and that she is part of mine.</p>
<p>On Saturday and Sunday, I spent time finishing small tasks that had been pending for a long time—giving feedback, replying to emails, and more.</p>
<p>I enjoyed working on my desk</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I had a call with two of my friends to discuss their learning pathways and career paths. In the development sector—especially when you&rsquo;re working with an NGO in the education space—your growth is not always predictable or linear. It’s not like the corporate world, where you get promotions at regular intervals.
What if you want to remain an educator, continue working directly with children, and still grow in other aspects of life—money, new skills, new kinds of learning, or new types of projects?
What if you don’t see “Project Manager” as your next goal?
What should a growth pathway look like that gives you enough challenges to stay inspired, helps you feel meaning in your work, and shifts as you move through different life phases?</p>
<p>I have developed a questionnaire for personal reflection. Whenever I consider changing my job / taking new project, I ask myself these questions. This time, I shared them with friends who are also looking for clarity and new ideas. Let’s see if it helps. Let me know if you’re interested in a framework to think about your next move—I’d be happy to share it. We can even have a one-on-one call to brainstorm and explore together.</p>
<p>This framework includes reflecting on your personal philosophy / values, strengths, interests, learning aspirations, financial needs, and cultural/social/emotional needs. It&rsquo;s also useful for documenting your past work and building your portfolio.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing some thoughts on self-directed learning and portfolio-making with the <em>Sanjhe Sapne</em> team. We&rsquo;re having weekly learning calls, and I’m enjoying them so much.</p>
<p>I’m also working with the YouCAN – Earth Educator Fellows, sharing my insights about working with children and developing programs. I’m learning a lot from each one of them. As an alum of this fellowship, I feel very grateful for the opportunity to stay connected with like-minded and like-hearted people.</p>
<p>A big part of my work revolves around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing tools and creating environments for self-directed learning</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel the need to start documenting my frameworks and ideas—maybe that will be the topic for my next blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="sakha-fellowship-updates-">Sakha Fellowship Updates :</h4>
<p>Sakhaz are working on two projects. One is an inquiry project around rural/village issues. They’ve prepared a survey form and visited a village near Waghodia. The second project is about interviewing unsung heroes. They started by interviewing a 100-year-old <em>masi</em> who runs a <em>sev-usal</em> shop in Vadodara.</p>
<p>We both feel so happy seeing the updates, but unfortunately, we haven’t been able to engage with the Sakhaz in person. We only get Saturdays and Sundays off — and those are usually packed with our other project meetings, home maintenance work, and a bit of downtime. That’s also when the Sakha team meets in Vadodara.</p>
<p>Technically, Vadodara is just 3 hours away, but it takes us 1 hour just to get to a place from where we can catch a bus. We’d need to leave work early on Friday evening, and we don’t have a place to stay in Vadodara either. So, all of this makes it really difficult… but we’ll find a way to join in somehow.</p>
<p>We really miss the energy and connection with the Sakhaz.</p>
<hr>
<p>The rest of the week was mostly filled with office work.
This week was also filled with some existential questions—
Is my work worth doing?
Am I on the right path?
What is my relationship with money, and with my employer?</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I feel like I’m in a phase of life where my ambitions to “make it big” or “be successful” in the conventional sense are getting quieter. I’m okay with slow and small now.
What’s calling me more is building meaningful relationships—with peers, friends, partner, family, the larger ecosystem and support system. I want to invest in that, rather than chasing individual success. Supporting friends in finding their paths, doing projects together, sharing ideas, contacts, networks, resources—without guarding them. Meeting people without agendas. Just being grateful and feeling enough—for who I am and who others are.</p>
<p>I’m slowly becoming less aggressive about pushing my own ideas—trying to learn the art of listening, of understanding other perspectives.</p>
<p>Over the last few months—conflicts at home, changing dynamics at work, and the deepening of my relationship with my partner—have all changed me.
Maybe it’s just age.I have turned 30 this May.</p>
<p>I was also feeling anxious during parts of this week because of some work tasks, but somehow I managed. Writing and journaling help—they slow down my thoughts and help me feel calm.</p>
<p>I’m considering therapy to work on my overall mental health, which has been affected by multiple things over the past few months.</p>
<p>Anyway… it was a good week.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I watched an old Marathi web series and listened to some beautiful, slow Hindi and Marathi songs.</p>

<p><strong>Rain has started in Ahmedabad:</strong></p>

<p><strong>I remembered this beautiful poem by my dear friend Hemant Deolekar:</strong></p>
<p><strong>पेड़ों का अंतर्मन</strong></p>
<p><em>हेमंत देवलेकर</em></p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>कल मानसून की पहली बरसात हुई</p>
<p>और आज यह दरवाज़ा ख़ुशी से फूल गया है</p>
<p>खिड़की दरवाज़े महज़ लकड़ी नहीं हैं विस्थापित जंगल होते हैं</p>
<p>मुझे लगा, मैं पेड़ों के बीच से आता-जाता हूँ</p>
<p>टहनियों पर बैठता हूँ</p>
<p>पेड़ों की खोखल में रहती हैं किताबें</p>
<p>मैं, जंगल में घिरा हूँ</p>
<p>किंवदंतियों में रहने वाला</p>
<p>आदिम ख़ुशबू से भरा जंगल</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>कल मौसम की पहली बारिश हुई</p>
<p>और आज यह दरवाज़ा</p>
<p>चौखट में फँसने लगा है</p>
<p>वह बंद होना नहीं चाहता</p>
<p>ठीक दरख़्तों की तरह</p>
<p>एक कटे हुए जिस्म में</p>
<p>पेड़ का ख़ून फिर दौड़ने लगा है</p>
<p>और यह दरवाज़ा बचपन की स्मृतियों में खो गया है</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>याद आने लगा है</p>
<p>किस तरह वह बाँहें फैलाकर</p>
<p>हज़ारों हथेलियों में समेटा करता था</p>
<p>बारिश को</p>
<p>और झूमने लगता था</p>
<p>वह स्मृतियों में फिर हरा हुआ है।</p>

<p>This will be a short note. Nothing much happened this week.</p>
<p>We celebrated International Play Day at the office, and it was super fun! The office team asked our relatives for our childhood photos and made a beautiful collage. It was really, really enjoyable to recognize each other from childhood photographs. We played games and shared our childhood memories.</p>
<p>One of our close friends came to spend time with us at our place. I feel very wholesome when someone comes to spend time with us without any specific agenda—cooking together, eating together, talking, sharing ideas, taking a walk together. That gives me warmth and makes me feel loved.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m realizing that spending time with friends, family, and loved ones is what&rsquo;s truly interesting. I should do it more. One part of myself always leans towards interesting projects, but now I want to consciously choose the projects and people I work with, as well as my working patterns. I want to invest my time and energy in spending time and having interesting experiences with loved ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering why people aspire for job stability or working long-term in one organization. It&rsquo;s because it gives you security and belonging—you get time and mental space to think about other things in life. When you stay at one organization and remain in one place (city or town), you make connections with that city. It would be wonderful to have friends nearby. Living close to your dear friends is a bliss.</p>
<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t feel connected to Ahmedabad. I felt connected to Vadodara, Bhuj, and Bangalore. I need to make more effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling very grateful to the universe. We&rsquo;re both getting very nice work opportunities. I&rsquo;m working with organizations and projects, directly or indirectly, that I&rsquo;m really aligned with. Sometimes it&rsquo;s overwhelming to work on too many projects, and I get anxiety, but it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m learning to manage it.</p>
<p>We started an online yoga class, but it&rsquo;s not working well. In a week, we only did it for two days. It&rsquo;s not a live class—they&rsquo;re doing YouTube live with interactive chat. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I wish to start some legitimate sports activity like cycling, swimming, or running.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now regular with breakfast, making very simple things like ragi malt with milk and dry fruits, or oats.</p>
<p>I bought Kesar mangoes from our office&rsquo;s mango orchard. They are so yummy! We made aam ras and loved it.</p>
<h2 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday and Tuesday: The nature classroom team is coming to visit the learning center. They are developing a nature education assessment framework. During this visit, they will test some of their work with children.</li>
<li>Nidhi is going to conduct nature education sessions with teachers in Mumbai next week.</li>
<li>The Sakha group is doing a geo inquiry project. We had an initial meeting.</li>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to combine two weekly notes, but there&rsquo;s no option now—it&rsquo;s too late. The last two weeks were super happening, but I&rsquo;ll keep it short here. Sunday is almost gone and too many work tasks are pending.</p>
<p>Let me start with this: I miss BLR. Weather, food, people—everything&hellip; I follow specific people on Twitter just to take in Bangalore vibes.</p>
<p>26th &amp; 27th went into office work. We took a flight from Ahmedabad to Bangalore on the 28th morning, reached there by afternoon. Met Thejesh for the first time. It was nice to have a chat with him about life, work, food, and other stuff. When you read a person&rsquo;s weekly notes, you feel you already know them.</p>

<p>We visited a friend&rsquo;s place in HSR, freshened up, met another dear friend Jubin, had dinner, and caught the bus for Coonoor. Reached early morning.</p>
<p>We were unprepared for Coonoor&rsquo;s weather (no sweater, no proper footwear for the rocky terrain). We borrowed a sweater from someone and somehow managed.</p>
<p>Spent 5 days with amazing nature educators who came from all over India &amp; the YouCAN team. It was a mix of feelings—it gave me a sense of belonging to the community that I am an alumni of this fellowship. In some moments it gave me self-doubt, and in other moments it gave me profound inspiration.</p>

<p>We met dear friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theearthlynotes/">Adithi Muralidhar</a> at Coonoor. I did my internship under her at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education - Design &amp; Technology Education lab, Mumbai.</p>
<p>While coming back, we again halted in BLR, met Ruchir, the Nature Classrooms team, and folks from Nature Conservation Foundation. Visiting Nature Classroom&rsquo;s office, meeting the all-girls team, and seeing their amazing work gives me happiness, hope, and inspiration. Someday I want to build a space/org like this in my native place.</p>

<p>3rd June - we&rsquo;re back in town—Ahmedabad.
4th I did work from home. 5th I went to the office.</p>
<p>I got sick on the 6th. Suddenly got fever and loose motions&hellip; it was food poisoning. Still recovering. I don&rsquo;t know how I got it—maybe because of traveling or outside food or heat, don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m thankful that it&rsquo;s not covid. I&rsquo;m feeling better now.</p>
<p>No reading during the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Music : We sang nice songs during the campfire at the fellowship residency. That night is memorable.</p>
<p>Overall mood is happy but a little stressed because of too many pending tasks at the office and also from other side projects.</p>
<p>Sakha fellowship work is going well. Ashish bhai and Rameshwari ben are leading it very well. Today me and Nidhi attended one team meeting, and we got some new updates.</p>
<p>Sakhas are taking up new projects. One of the groups wants to start a podcast for unsung heroes from daily life, one group wants to visit villages and explore the issues over there. Me and Nidhi are thinking to meet them and help them convert their project into a <a href="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/file/Educator_Guide_Geo_Inquiry_Final_2.pdf">geo inquiry project</a>. Anyone interested in developing and documenting geo inquiry projects with children, please let me know. Happy to collaborate. We&rsquo;re also planning to host sessions on financial literacy, gender, and youth-life-related stuff. No motivation or gyan. Real problems of youth and exploration for the same.</p>
<p>Otherwise, everything is going well. I need to catch up with a few friends and do proper planning for the side projects.</p>
<h3 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates:</h3>
<p>Dear friend Siddhartha helped us make the final logo of KBM. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple and cute logo. Chappal is part of the logo because our central idea is exploration and inquiry, and what&rsquo;s a better medium to do exploration than &lsquo;walk&rsquo;!! So the chappal (footwear) :)</p>
<p>We also launched our Instagram handle on 5th June—World Environment Day. Check it out here.</p>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;inspiration-is-a-beautiful-cycle&#34;&gt;Inspiration is a Beautiful Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note by Janantik Shukla&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;101: 3-Day Mobile Filmmaking Workshop with Sakha Fellows at Vadodara and Nareshwar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inspiration is a beautiful cycle for any artist. When we inspire the younger generation, they return the favor with their fresh energy, new stories, and poetry.

<p>Note by Janantik Shukla</p>
<hr>
<p>101: 3-Day Mobile Filmmaking Workshop with Sakha Fellows at Vadodara and Nareshwar.</p>
<p>Inspiration is a beautiful cycle for any artist. When we inspire the younger generation, they return the favor with their fresh energy, new stories, and poetry. In the process, we find ourselves traveling back to our own younger days.</p>
<p>Personally, after spending time with the students during this workshop, I felt recharged—ready to face clients, making pitch, the frustration of delayed payments, and the rejections that come with keep creating and capturing beautiful stories on screen.</p>
<p>During the three-day workshop, we explored theatre, visual storytelling, and memory exercises. We also screened a range of short films and a feature. As part of a storytelling exercise, the students initially came up with a web series idea that couldn’t be filmed in just half a day. So they pivoted and developed four new stories—all centered around the river.</p>
<p>Out of those four, they managed to shoot and edit two films. While the films are still in the first-cut stage, I’ll share them once they’re ready.</p>
<p>Super proud of the Sakha Fellows!</p>
<p>Thanks Mihir Pathak for wonderful opportunity.</p>

<p>Note by Mihir Pathak</p>
<p>We set out to explore our river — its deep connection with life, its biodiversity, and the rich socio-cultural stories that flow alongside it.</p>
<p>Taking baby steps, we began this journey through the powerful medium of film making. With the amazing Janantik Shukla guiding us, we discovered new ways of seeing and storytelling.</p>
<p>Film Making Workshop | 23rd to 25th May 2025</p>
<hr>
<p>Note by Suraj Kori</p>
<p>The Sakha Fellowship volunteer group successfully hosted an inspiring 3-day Filmmaking Workshop, engaging 25 enthusiastic students from high school and college. Led by Janantik Shukla, the workshop began with an exciting day in Vadodara, followed by a two-day residential camp near the serene Narmada River.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our incredible mentors - Ashish Bhangaokar, Rameshwari Gajjar, and Mihir Pathak - whose guidance made this journey truly transformative.</p>
<p>From scripting and shooting to editing and storytelling, the workshop was a perfect blend of learning and fun, sparking creativity and collaboration among all participants.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who made this experience unforgettable!</p>

Let me tell you, I really, really love my Pilot V7/V5 pens. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I lost it—I used to lose it when I worked in schools. I generally use my Pilot pen to make notes in notebooks. I love the smoothness of the writing experience that comes with liquid ink. The V7 has a refill cartridge. I have Hi-Tech Point Pen ink, which I put into the cartridge and use the pen again. This can be done 3 to 4 times. After that, ink overflows from the joint near the nib.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This week was super hectic, and the coming week is also going to be hectic as we&rsquo;re traveling to Coonoor for the Earth Educator Workshop and meeting people in Bangalore.</p>

<p>This week started by losing my Pilot pen. Let me tell you, I really, really love my Pilot V7/V5 pens. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I lost it—I used to lose it when I worked in schools. I generally use my Pilot pen to make notes in notebooks. I love the smoothness of the writing experience that comes with liquid ink. The V7 has a refill cartridge. I have Hi-Tech Point Pen ink, which I put into the cartridge and use the pen again. This can be done 3 to 4 times. After that, ink overflows from the joint near the nib.</p>
<p>I prefer black ink over blue or other colors. I also have other ink pens for which I use Sulekha Swadeshi green ink.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, Nidhi found the lost pen in one of my shirt pockets.</p>
<hr>
<p>I finally cleaned my laptop&rsquo;s fan. I ordered a screwdriver from Blinkit, watched a video on YouTube, and opened the back cover of my super light ThinkPad Carbon. I observed that there was no heat sink paste remaining on the processor, so I decided to buy paste from Amazon and apply it myself.</p>
<p>It was around ₹500 to ₹1000. I searched for local shops and asked for rates. Finally, a very nearby shop did it for ₹300.</p>

<p>Nidhi made thali pith. We wanted to make something tasty and fast. A friend suggested this, and Nidhi made it nicely on her first attempt. She was super happy.</p>

<hr>
<p>I had an online learning circle call with the Sanjhe Sapne team. We&rsquo;re going to have this call every month. I&rsquo;ll share more about it some other time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Office colleagues came home on Wednesday evening. We had homemade cold coffee and lots of talking. We want to host friends and serve healthy drinks like ragi malt, hibiscus tea, aam panna, and sattu.</p>
<p>Nidhi made idli sambar. Now we feel at ease making idli sambar. We still need to buy a cast iron tava for dosa. Any good recommendations?</p>
<hr>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s friend from Azim Premji University came to our home. We both feel very happy when someone comes to our place just to stay without any agenda, to spend quality time. It&rsquo;s a privilege to get time to go to your friend&rsquo;s place and just stay.</p>

<p>Friday evening we left for Vadodara. We spent our weekend with children and the Sakha Fellowship team. We had wonderful filmmaking with children.</p>

<p>Weekend traveling was hectic. We took an AC Volvo bus. It was super expensive—a normal bus is ₹100 and Volvo is around ₹320—but it was helpful in this heat and with back pain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates</h2>
<p>I had a call with Adhvan about developing a map module. I want to develop activities where children can connect to their own place—town—city. Knowing local plants, trees, vendors, systems, being part of citizenship activities, heritage, conservation, using senses, walking.</p>
<p>Something like: Re-imagining Maps - Explore the science and art of cartography through conversations about maps and interactive mapmaking. This is an invitation to renegotiate how we interact with landscapes, how we understand maps, and how we document the spaces we occupy and the lives we live within them.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends shared an address of a famous Hindi author, which comes with a footnote after the main address:</p>
<p>🌱 (कटोरा तालाब मुख्य मार्ग में बूढ़ी मां मंदिर तक आना होगा। मंदिर के सामने मुख्यमार्ग में माँ शारदा होम्योपैथी दुकान के बाजू की सड़क पर अंदर आखिरी घर है।)</p>
<p>🌳 अंदर आने वाली सड़कों पर बोर्ड लगे हैं। जिस बोर्ड में कटोरा तालाब सड़क नंबर 11 लिखा है, उसी सड़क पर अंदर आना होगा। दाहिने ओर का सबसे आखिरी घर है।</p>
<p>घर के अंदर एक आम का पेड़, घर के बाहर एक ओर मौलश्री के दो पेड़ और दूसरी ओर सप्तपर्णी, मौलश्री, करंज के पेड़ भी रहते हैं। साथ में गिलहरियां, चिड़ियां और हम सब भी।</p>
<p>Are we connected to our place apart from Google Map locations? What Google Maps shows are commercially active places like malls, petrol pumps, shops—not trees, small shops, small landmarks, small water bodies. Anything that&rsquo;s not generating money is not on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Can we design our own maps? Can we use maps as a tool to connect with ourselves and the places we live in? Can this become an activity module?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super interested in this project. Let me know if you want to collaborate in any capacity.</p>
<p>Another project I want to work on is &lsquo;fostering wonder and awe&rsquo; in children&rsquo;s lives, very much inspired by the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacher_Keltner">Dacher Keltner</a>. I want to work with children from 3 to 11 years of age.</p>
<p>Read: <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2024.1229029">Wonder-Full Hearts: Awe Turns Children into Caring Champions</a></p>
<p>I actually struggle to keep these two personalities—one which is very playful, curious, and storytelling while working with little children, and suddenly shifting to social justice, connecting with place, and citizenship ideas while working with older children or educators. I keep shifting between these. But ultimately everything is the same&hellip; be playful, curious, walk slowly, and wonder more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="social-media-usage">Social Media Usage</h2>
<p>I consume Instagram, which shows me mostly artists, photographers, writers, and nature lover profiles and posts. Posting on Instagram is getting less frequent. I want to put selected weekly note photos on social media regularly, but it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>I consume LinkedIn, which shows me mostly people and posts from the development sector. I&rsquo;m literally fed up with that.</p>
<p>Twitter shows me mostly developers and entrepreneurs from Bangalore.</p>
<p>Apart from all of this, I really enjoy reading weekly notes from different people. I use a feed reader to track and read weekly notes from selected people.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall mood is happy.</p>
<p>My reading is paused again. I&rsquo;ll try to resume it in June.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="12th-may-to-18th-may-2025-monday-to-sunday">12th May to 18th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>This week was Happy Week. I tried enjoying each and every day as it came.
Not getting time to write my weekly note on Sunday and finishing it on Monday is getting difficult. I want to write in detail but I&rsquo;m not getting the mental space.</p>
<p>I got a new laptop from the office - a ThinkPad E16.
It is heavy, runs Windows, has a big screen,
and battery backup is good.</p>
<p>The first few days I was not ready to leave my Carbon and shift to this because of my set workflow. But according to office policy, I needed to, so finally I moved.</p>
<p>My Carbon is giving me little problems nowadays. The venting system in X series is not that great. In Ahmedabad&rsquo;s heat, the fan of my machine is going mad. On the other side, the E16 is working smoothly.</p>
<p>I asked a few friends - they said there must be dust in the fan which needs to be cleaned, and I should avoid tasks with high CPU usage. I will clean it and see.</p>
<hr>
<p>From Monday to Wednesday, we had a storytelling workshop by Vikram Sridhar at our office.
On Tuesday, we went to The Calico Museum of Textiles as part of the workshop.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad is called a &lsquo;World Heritage City&rsquo; and it has 30+ museums. I never saw this city through a heritage lens.But now both Nidhi and I have decided to see this city through this lens. We want to start by going on heritage walks, visiting museums, and being part of the theater culture here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tuesday we watched a film called &lsquo;Bangalore Days.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a nice, fun film in Malayalam. We watched it with subtitles. Nidhi recommended this film; she watched it a few years ago and she really liked it.</p>
<p>We also finished the film &lsquo;Angoor,&rsquo; which we had started watching earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summer break at school, so our canteen is closed. That means I need to prepare food at home and take a lunch box. For me, waking up early and making food is difficult. Same with Nidhi. I can do reading, writing, and other kinds of work in the morning, but not cooking. Nidhi is helping so much with cooking lunch and breakfast. Slowly, I have also started making breakfast. So now in the morning, we both are stretching ourselves and preparing food.</p>
<p>Nidhi is also experimenting with dinner and snacks. She loves cooking and experimenting with food. She&rsquo;s basically a foodie. I am cognitively very interested in food but slowly getting interested in the hands-on part of it - I mean cooking. For me, it&rsquo;s a long way to go. I know basic cooking like making khichadi, sabji, dal-chawal&hellip; I need to learn roti. Most importantly, I need to learn how to use the kitchen neatly.</p>
<p>Apart from this, we both want to constantly work on our diet because of our sensitive stomachs. Especially my stomach, which is very sensitive. The doctor told me that it&rsquo;s like the stomach of a 6-year-old. So we both need to remind ourselves to eat at home and eat millets, fruits,things with less masala.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday, we started watching a web series called &lsquo;Very Parivarik&rsquo; by TVF. It is a very relatable show.</p>
<p>On the same day, we had a long conversation about spending quality time with each other. For both of us, quality time means different things. Example : For Nidhi, it&rsquo;s cooking together, and for me, it&rsquo;s discussing ideas/brainstorming together. So we made a list of things and shared with each other. We also made a kind of timetable to fit everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>We went to Aarambh Cafe on Saturday evening. I was craving good sambar. Actually, Kamla Cafe, Aarambh Cafe, Kasturba Cafe, Atithi Restaurant, and Thepla Sabji from Gajanand - these are places that serve food which we can eat without worrying about our stomachs.</p>

<p><strong>We discussed Khojbeen Mandali activities. Some updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of our friends from Eklavya Foundation, Melody, wrote an article on &lsquo;Development of Aesthetic Sense in Primary Grades Through Nature-Based Activities&rsquo; which got published in a journal by Azim Premji University. I was part of this project, creating activities and mentoring the facilitator. Now we are planning to publish this work in other magazines like Sandarbh, Vikalp Sangam, and Nature Classrooms blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Nature Classrooms book &lsquo;There Is Nothing There,&rsquo; which Nidhi translated into Hindi, we are collaborating with Eklavya Foundation to print it in Hindi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are inviting Tanaya from Nature Classrooms to come to Ahmedabad. She will be observing pilots about nature education assessment tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are conducting a local Khoji film-making camp this coming weekend (23rd to 25th May)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tried developing a logo and visual identity for Khojbeen Mandali with a few friends. We gained some clarity about what we want during the process. We&rsquo;re going with what I made initially. One more friend is helping to make it better. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll get something interesting in the next few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coonoor trip for Earth Educator Workshop. (28th May to 3rd June 2025)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Sunday we went to Vikram Sridhar&rsquo;s storytelling performance at Scrap Yard. We enjoyed driving the Activa at night on surprisingly less trafficked roads.</p>
<p>I spent time coordinating with the team for the local Khoji camp.</p>
<p>I started reading again but am not getting uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="5th-may-to-11th-may-2025-monday-to-sunday">5th May to 11th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>It was my birthday week. I never celebrated birthdays explicitly in my childhood or even in my adulthood - no cake cutting, no party. In school, May 9th was mostly vacation time. In adulthood, I worked in schools, so again I had vacation during that time. At home, mom used to make my favorite food &lsquo;vedhmi&rsquo; / puran poli. I never got a chance to celebrate my birthday with friends. I remember celebrating once with my Eklavya office colleagues, friends, and participants.</p>
<p>But this time was different. Nidhi and friends made it super special.</p>
<p>Apart from that, this week was full of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness because of the political situation in the country and the situation at my home. I messaged my friends in Bhuj to check on them during blackout days. Got news about the ceasefire and very soon after, the breaking of that ceasefire.</p>
<p>At home, also ceasefire happened; we involved some other family members too. Mom went to Padra on Sunday. Let&rsquo;s see how long this ceasefire lasts&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> was a regular office day. There was a storm in the evening. It was raining at night. Nidhi made wonderful cold coffee in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> I worked from home. My stomach was not well.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> I also worked from home because of rain. We went to Teapost, Sindhu Bhavan Road in the evening.</p>
<p>We received the <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/2025/05/07/nagarathna-memorial-grant-2025-results/">Nagarathna Memorial Grant</a>. We will use the grant money for the local khoji camp coming up at the end of May.</p>
<p><strong>On Thursday</strong>, we set up paintings. Now this home feels like home.</p>

<p>Buying plants and setting up composting is still pending.</p>
<p>Me, Bansi, and Nidhi went to Kamla Cafe for dinner and walked back home.
We had a chat about life until late night.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>We started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215517/">Angoor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Nidhi and I read a small book about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenu_Kuruba">Jenu Kuruba Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The Jenu Kuruba are a tribal group from the Nilgiris, numbering around 37,000.They are concentrated in the districts bordering the states of Kerala and Karnataka.
&lsquo;Jenu&rsquo; means &lsquo;honey&rsquo; in Kannada, referring to their traditional occupation as collectors of honey in the forest.</p>

<p>This week went by incredibly fast. There were many meetings at the office, and work is really gearing up. I didn&rsquo;t get time to explore anything beyond work.</p>
<p>This week, Nidhi did many cooking experiments. She loves cooking and experimenting with food. She made the following dishes throughout the week:</p>

<p>I forgot to take photo of Bhindi kadhi</p>
<p>On Sunday, we made idli sambar. I tried my hand at making sambar following Nidhi&rsquo;s instructions. It turned out nice for a first attempt.</p>
<p>We went grocery shopping at a superstore. We reflected on how we&rsquo;re becoming disconnected from local kirana stores and small businesses. We&rsquo;ve started referring to malls and superstores as &ldquo;Maya Bazaar.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re going to try finding ways to purchase more items from kirana stores—less superstore shopping, less Blinkit ordering, and less Instagram-influenced purchasing.</p>
<p>Nidhi did some trial English-to-Hindi translation work for NCF outreach. If selected, she&rsquo;ll be doing translations related to nature and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Setting up our composting system and buying plants are still pending. Time seems to rush from one task to another, leaving me feeling neither rested nor free from the tension of uncompleted tasks.</p>
<p>It was enjoyable having lunch and dinner together on Saturday and Sunday. We often feel the urge to watch something while eating. We&rsquo;ve started watching old shows like &ldquo;Vikram Vetal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Byomkesh Bakshi.&rdquo; We try to select shows that Mom can also enjoy.</p>
<p>We watched the Gujarati film &ldquo;Reva.&rdquo; Though Nidhi and I had seen it before, we watched it again with Mom.</p>
<p>Nidhi is collecting seeds from the fruits we&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>I started taking ragi malt for breakfast and am loving it.</p>
<p>Mom is okay. Things are on hold. Let&rsquo;s see what happens next.</p>
<p>We want to launch an Instagram page for our nature education/experiential learning initiative. We&rsquo;ve named it &lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali,&rsquo; embodying the spirit of curiosity, wonder, and inquiry. A bunch of friends are helping us create a logo and Instagram templates. I could have started with the basic elements I already have, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying the process of crafting an identity and translating ideas into visuals. This has been the highlight of my week, along with, of course, the delicious food prepared by Nidhi and Mom. I&rsquo;m very grateful to them.</p>
<p>We are going to Coonoor for a workshop at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve booked our tickets. We&rsquo;re also planning to spend one day in Bangalore to meet friends. We are very excited about this trip.</p>
<p>This week involved no reading apart from office work, and no music either. I need to get back to reading.</p>
<p>Overall mood : I am ok, not in much stress. I am trying to keep my self calm and happy.</p>

<p>This week was again a roller coaster ride. Too much is happening. I am not getting the mindspace to write this weekly note in detail, so I am just putting down pointers.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal office day. After a long weekend, all teammates gathered and had a nice catch-up.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took leave. Nidhi and I went to Vadodara. Mom came back with us. The home situation is not well.</p>
<p>We had a clay workshop in the office. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions with children at the learning center are on pause because of summer vacation. They will resume in June. Nowadays, she is working on developing project-based nature education modules for grades 6 to 9.</p>
<p>Mummy was sharing about having difficulty in reading. Nidhi and Mummy went to Lenskart and got a new pair of glasses. Lenskart made the whole eye test and spectacle buying experience very smooth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.earthfocus.in/">Earth Focus</a> team sent a copy of &lsquo;Stop, Look and Wonder,&rsquo; their nature education curriculum. I had the opportunity to review the curriculum while they were developing it last year.</p>

<p>I shared learning resources on the following topics through blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/childhoodinindia/">Childhood in India</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/play/">Education and Play</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/reflectivewriting/">Reflective Writing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I watched this podcast again to get inspired by the wonderful work they are doing:</p>

    </div>

<p>The Papon concert got canceled due to the Kashmir incident. Both the artist and organizer decided to cancel it, and we got a full refund. It was going to be our first concert experience.</p>
<p>We bought a big plastic drum to start our composting journey. We still need to get soil.</p>
<p>At the office, we hosted a nature education session with children. Nidhi also joined for it. I am so glad and grateful that she could come. She is always a big support and inspiration for me. I am very grateful to my office team also for initiating and being part of it.</p>

<p>I played &lsquo;Cards Against Humanity&rsquo; for the first time. It was horrible! :) But I enjoyed games that are language-heavy, where you need to make jokes, play with vocabulary, and talk in metaphors. I will write in detail about this in another post.</p>

<p>Finally, we bought a 70L cooler from Vijay Sales. We wanted to buy from a local manufacturer/non-branded cooler because it&rsquo;s cheaper, but we couldn&rsquo;t find any shops selling them. So finally, we went to Croma but didn&rsquo;t get good rates. Eventually, we bought it from Vijay Sales.</p>
<p>We have two bedrooms, and we tried setting up the cooler so both rooms get some cool air, allowing us to avoid using the AC. It worked, but we need to keep doors open all night. We&rsquo;re thinking about buying one more small cooler or using the AC in the bedroom&hellip; let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is we didn&rsquo;t get a pipe and noseal in nearby shops. We went to a nearby mall (Mr. DIY), but the pipe was very expensive there. Finally, we found an option on Blinkit that we need to order. I continuously feel that we&rsquo;re getting disconnected from the local ecosystem because of this apartment lifestyle.</p>
<p>Saturday, Nidhi, Mom, and I went to Kamla Cafe for dinner.</p>
<p>Sunday, we had a call with our financial advisor to understand health insurance. It was very interesting to learn how it works. The process to claim insurance is getting stricter because of the many frauds happening in the country. We also had a short discussion about registering our own trust / NGO to facilitate our work with children. Two three already suggested the same thing but we are still thinking about the idea.</p>
<p>I had a call about storytelling and setting up a library space with a teacher working in Kendriya Vidyalaya. She is doing storytelling with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankittellsstories/?originalSubdomain=in">Ankit from TISS Mumbai</a>.</p>
<p>The home situation is getting worse. I am in constant stress and anxiety. Let&rsquo;s hope things get better in the coming week.</p>

I published my last note on the 16th. I could have published a combined note for weeks 15 &amp;amp; 16, but I didn’t want to miss anything while combining them. Combining two weeks felt like a ‘very long time’, and I wanted to be there with my fellow weekly note-writers… so here I am with weekly note 16/2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>My weekly note cycle got affected because of travel. I published my last note on the 16th. I could have published a combined note for weeks 15 &amp; 16, but I didn’t want to miss anything while combining them. Combining two weeks felt like a ‘very long time’, and I wanted to be there with my fellow weekly note-writers… so here I am with weekly note 16/2025.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I went to the office after a week-long break. There were very few people from our team because of the long weekend.</p>
<p>My back pain returned. I was standing and tried to pick up something from the floor when it hurt terribly. I just got to the fridge, and Nidhi helped me with an ice pack. It worked.</p>
<p>On Friday, we spent time decorating our home with small items we have, like fridge magnets and some toys. The paintings are still waiting to be framed.</p>

<p>Nidhi made a bandhanwar.</p>
<p>Our Activa wasn’t starting. We tried repeatedly and finally went to a nearby garage. The mechanic put in a new battery, serviced the brakes, and changed the engine oil. Now it’s running very smoothly.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went to CEE. We visited a new shop called InStore and tried to visit CEE’s nature shop, but it was closed. We went to Aarambh Cafe and had hibiscus tea, dosa, and uttapam.</p>

<p>I like the sambar from this place. The hibiscus tea was costly but we enjoyed it. We ate out a lot last week, so we decided to work on getting back into our cooking rhythm.</p>
<p>InStore’s curation was super cool; I really liked their collection of origami lamps, ceramic wind chimes, and other items. I was amazed at how “eco-friendly,” “organic,” and “sustainable life” products have been commercialized. Nidhi mentioned after seeing the products that we could make these at home. But do we have the time? Do we have the skills? And again, do we have time to invest in developing these skills?</p>
<p>On Saturday, we conducted a natural color-making workshop with children at the Tatvic office. Nidhi led the session. It was fun!</p>

<p>I cleaned my laptop with isopropyl alcohol. It looks nice now, and I enjoy working on it more.</p>
<p>We went out to find materials for Sunday’s workshop. We wanted plastic straws for making “toys from trash” (Arvind Gupta toys). Surprisingly, we didn’t find plastic straws in stationery shops, Mr. DIY, or shops selling disposable items. Everyone is selling steel or paper straws. We couldn’t find plastic straws at all, which was interesting! Anyway, we only checked around the Thaltej area, so geography matters.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we conducted another workshop on “Fun with Science”/toys from trash with children at the Tatvic office. We made a balloon rocket, which didn’t work for some reason. We did two more interesting experiments that amazed the children. They shared lots of ideas about how those particular things work. I’ll try to write a detailed post about this.</p>

<p>We ordered a helmet from Amazon—a Vega Atom. It’s a nice, compact, lightweight helmet. I like it. Now I can drive more confidently.</p>
<p>we are now using AC on daily basis. We are getting habitual, which we don’t want for multiple reasons.. environment, money, health.. we are thinking to buy small cooler.</p>
<p>The situation at home is bad again. I get anxious whenever someone calls me from there. I really don’t know how to handle this. I feel helpless. Last week everything was ok, suddenly things changed.</p>

<p>My reading paused during the Bhopal visit. This week I read a few pages from the book “Mane Fom Chhe.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-april-to-16th-april-2025-monday-to-wed">7th April to 16th April 2025 (Monday to Wed)</h4>
<p>This time I am a little delayed in writing my weekly note. This week was super busy.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal work day at the office.</p>
<p>I made a very basic version of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voicesofvishwamitri/?hl=en">VoV</a> website on WordPress. I need help in curating content and page design ideas. I&rsquo;m not getting enough time to work on it.</p>
<p>Tuesday &amp; Wednesday we had a &lsquo;storytelling workshop&rsquo; at the office by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_storytellingfellow/?hl=en">Vikram Sridhar</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, we left for Bhopal. Nidhi got a confirmed ticket because of tatkal booking, and I got an RAC ticket (I booked it a few days ago). Finally, we slept on Nidhi&rsquo;s seat and gave the other seat to the RAC fellow. It was a tiring journey.</p>
<p>Eklavya is our second home. Whenever we go there, we meet our close friends and colleagues. This place is super welcoming - welcoming you, your ideas; it&rsquo;s not just a workplace but a family for nomads like us. We share everything with each other, from personal life to work life.</p>
<p>This visit was special because we were visiting Eklavya for the first time after our wedding. We got lots of gifts &amp; hugs from our friends there. I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>Almost every day we went out to eat with friends, which was the best part of the trip.</p>
<p>Thursday: During my last visit, I tried <a href="https://myfoodstory.com/burmese-khow-suey-recipe/">veg khow suey</a> at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amerbakeryhut.bhopal/?hl=en">Amer Bakery, Bitten Market</a>. This time also we went there with friends and had it. I loved it.</p>

<p><strong>Khavsa: Gujarat connection of Khow Suey</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://curlytales.com/surats-khavsa-is-the-distant-cousin-of-burmas-khow-suey-know-about-its-interesting-history/">Khavsa</a>, a popular Gujarati street food, traces its roots back to Burma (Myanmar), where it is known as Khow Suey. The dish&rsquo;s journey to Gujarat is linked to the Memon community, who had strong trading ties with Myanmar. They adapted the Burmese Khow Suey to Gujarati tastes, resulting in the spicy, textured Khavsa we know today.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bought new footwear from Bata. It was long overdue. I didn&rsquo;t think much - went into the showroom with the idea to buy sandals but came out with Bata Quovadis chappals. They look like Birkenstock, but the build quality is very different. Overall, I liked them. They&rsquo;re very comfy and go well with my overall look, which is mostly cotton shirts with cotton cargo pants.</p>

<p>Friday: We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/icecreamfactoryindia/?hl=en">Shahi Durbar</a> and had wonderful mango &amp; guava ice cream. Had dinner at <a href="https://www.indiancoffeehouse.com/">The Indian Coffee House</a>. I&rsquo;m always fascinated to learn about the history and co-operative model of ICH. This time I learned more about its history from a friend and also read something on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Indian Coffee House chain has a significant historical connection to leftist movements, particularly the Indian Communist Party. During the 1950s, the Coffee Board&rsquo;s decision to shut down the chain sparked a workers&rsquo; revolt led by communist leader A.K. Gopalan, which ultimately led to the coffee houses being handed over to worker cooperatives. This event solidified the coffee house&rsquo;s identity as a space for left-leaning political activity and discussion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I realize why ICH isn&rsquo;t present in Gujarat!</p>
<p>Saturday: We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theten.in/?hl=en">The10</a> with all friends from the &lsquo;Child Development Course&rsquo;. We had a continental dinner - pasta, burrito bowl, broccoli risotto, nachos&hellip; I don&rsquo;t often consume this type of food. It was very new to me. I especially enjoyed the burrito, nachos, and falafal.</p>
<p>I shared my life updates with friends in detail. I was surprised that a few of them were regular weekly note readers. Meeting with friends, cracking jokes, sharing life updates was the best part of the trip. I am really, really grateful for all the friendships I&rsquo;ve made in this life.</p>
<p>Sunday: Nidhi and I went to &lsquo;Swadeshi Handicraft Mela&rsquo; with another group of friends. We heard from another friend that it&rsquo;s very affordable and interesting. I had the impression that handicraft melas are expensive, but we found very affordable and cool cotton shirts (ikat prints, block prints), Chikankari kurtas, cargo pants, and more. We also met some artisans from Kutch and bought handmade cushion covers from them. We also bought a wooden key stand. It&rsquo;s cute but was an impulsive and costly purchase. We spent more than 5K but got an amazing stock of clothes, especially for me because I don&rsquo;t easily find cotton cargos and shirts at this price. Nidhi also got some interesting items for herself.</p>
<p>Monday: We gave an ice cream treat to all the course participants. In the evening, we screened &lsquo;Laapataa Ladies&rsquo; in the workshop hall. Most of the audience was female. It was a nice experience to watch it together.</p>

<p>we bought books from Eklavya Pitara store for our office &amp; some selected nature related story books for Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions at learning center.</p>
<p>We took a train to Ahmedabad on Tuesday night. On the opposite berth, there was a 4-5 year old child with her parents. I asked her if she wanted to listen to a story from big book. We ended up exploring &lsquo;Saljam&rsquo; together as we traveled.&quot;</p>

<p>Wednesday: We are back in Ahmedabad. I will join the office tomorrow. This week will be busy. We have a summer camp at Ravi bhai&rsquo;s office on Saturday-Sunday. I am going to take a one-day session with a school associated with our office.</p>
<p>We made progress on our financial planning front. We bought health insurance for both of us. It was tough to think about, compare the plans, and figure out if it was the right decision or not. Our friend, a financial advisor, helped us a lot by listening, clarifying our doubts, and reassuring us.</p>
<p><a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/education/central-government-trying-to-scrap-bachelor-of-elementary-education-course-of-delhi-university-and-bring-in-integrated-teacher-education-programme/article66965018.ece">I got to know that Delhi University&rsquo;s B.El.Ed course is shutting down</a>. Two of our faculty members are associated with the same course. It&rsquo;s sad to hear about this. It&rsquo;s the most comprehensive course I&rsquo;ve seen for teacher education, with a nice balance of practice and theory.</p>
<p>This time during the child development workshop, I was observing other faculty members - how they take sessions, how they go slow, explaining concepts with examples and analogies. I do the same, but sometimes I hurry, don&rsquo;t go deeper, give monologues, don&rsquo;t use the blackboard effectively, and just talk.</p>
<p>They facilitate deeper understanding of concepts, whereas I sometimes jump straight to classroom application.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;ve come a long way with my facilitation style. I will keep all this in mind for the next workshop.</p>
<p>Today I had my first mango of this summer - &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banganapalle_%28mango%29">Banganapalle</a>&rsquo;.
For dinner we went to atithi restaurant for aam ras &amp; roti :)</p>
<p>Mummy is doing okay. She took Papa for an eye checkup. We found out that Papa needs to undergo cataract surgery. They found a hospital where they perform the surgery for free. I need to take leave from the office and accompany them for this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hegde_seema_/">Seema</a> started writing <a href="https://seemateeta.blogspot.com/2025/04/week-15-of-2025-sunday-to-saturday.html">weekly notes</a>. She is Horticulturist 👩🏻‍🌾❤️‍🔥, Phytophillic ☘️ living in a village called Hosalli in Sirsi, Karnataka. She writes about farming, gardening, books and other stuff.</p>
<p>I am realizing that I am an attention seeker, egotistical person. I want to be in the good books of everyone, I always want to prove my point and be on top&hellip; in my universe I am at the center. What should I do to be grounded? Listening is one thing I want to focus on from now onward.</p>
<p>Last year, Nidhi translated a book called &lsquo;There is nothing there&rsquo;. Now it is available as printed copy. You can buy it from <a href="https://ncf-store.zohocommerce.in/products/there-s-nothing-there-hindi/1638627000002181312">NCF Store</a> / download it as pdf from <a href="https://www.natureclassrooms.org/theres-nothing-there-book">Nature Classroom Website</a> (There is very interesting game based on this book, check it out !)</p>

<p>We made drumstick sabji on Monday evening. It is my favorite sabji. I love how my mom makes it. We tried our best to make it edible&hellip; the taste wasn&rsquo;t exactly like mom&rsquo;s, but it was nice. It was fun cooking together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mukherjiantara_art/?hl=en">Antara</a> gifted us nice paintings as a wedding gift. I gave one of the paintings for framing. I realized that wooden frames are quite costly. I&rsquo;m waiting to see how it will turn out.</p>
<p>I went to physiotherapy on Thursday. My height + long sitting hours + 20 to 25km of everyday driving on Activa + no exercises have all contributed to lower back pain and shoulder pain. I also started some basic stretching, applying ice packs, and taking breaks from sitting. I am in a much better state right now, but the pain is still there.</p>
<p>We had a call with <a href="https://www.youcan.in/">Ram - Rachita</a> on Friday. I was so happy to see them on screen after a long time.</p>
<p>We took on a nature education curriculum/module development project for grades 6 to 9. There is already wonderful work and content creation happening by <a href="https://palluyirtrust.org/">Palluyir Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.ncf-india.org/">Nature Conservation Foundation</a> (early bird, nature classroom, season watch), Wipro Earthian, and more. We are trying to curate and make it more contextual. Let&rsquo;s hope we create something meaningful.</p>
<p>I have developed and now manage two schools&rsquo; websites on <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. It&rsquo;s a nice, easy-to-use platform for basic stuff. This year they increased the price of their basic annual hosting plan from 2,338 Rs to 3,540 Rs (18% GST included). I think this is too much for our use case. Changing the platform and transferring the content is a task&hellip; let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t had the mental space to work on the &lsquo;Voices of Vishwamitri&rsquo; website. I need to focus on it this week.</p>
<p>Nidhi completed 4 sessions at the learning center. She is taking two sessions per week. Both the children and Nidhi are enjoying the sessions. I will ask Nidhi to share her documentation link so I can share more about the sessions.</p>
<p>Mom is at Padra. One week has passed. I talk to her on the phone almost every day, but I still miss her presence.</p>
<p>Next week on Wednesday, Nidhi and I will leave for Bhopal - Child Development Course at Eklavya. It will be a busy week. I am excited to meet all the friends.</p>
<p>I wrote a post on <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/tantra-in-day-to-day-life/">Tantra Vidya</a> in Gujarati based on Subhash Bhatt&rsquo;s video.</p>
<p>Today, we had a meeting with a financial advisor to start our investment and tax planning journey. It feels weird sometimes&hellip; we are now adults thinking about tax, investment, medical care, yoga subscriptions, and health supplements. By the way, let me know if you have any recommendations for protein powder and multivitamin supplements.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I am still reading &lsquo;Tilor&rsquo;. The story is progressing slowly, but the plot is very interesting, so I am continuing it. I may read &lsquo;Mane Fom Chhe&rsquo; in parallel.</p>

<p>I feel that I am constantly fighting. Fighting with &lsquo;convenience&rsquo;. Or fighting for convenience?</p>
<p>I lose every day&hellip; every hour&hellip; every minute.</p>
<p>In Ahmedabad, 39 to 40°C was the average high temperature last week. I feel guilty every time I switch on the AC in my room. I get images of fruit vendors, delivery people, and others in my mind. How are they living? I press the remote finally and keep the AC on for about 30 minutes or so&hellip; I start feeling anxious&hellip; &ldquo;The electricity bill will be high&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I doing the right thing?&rdquo; I switch off the AC, open the window, and try to acclimatize.</p>
<p>Last night I woke up in the middle of the night&hellip; I was sweating&hellip; it was too hot even at midnight. I switched on the AC&hellip; but my sleep was gone&hellip; I was fighting&hellip; fighting for convenience.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I had a discussion with Nidhi about not using plastic bags in the fridge to separate vegetables. We can use something else&hellip; or even spend time separating them when we want to prepare food. But she feels anxious if things aren&rsquo;t in place. Are we that busy? I think yes, we are busy&hellip; should I blame the system?</p>
<p>We took some cloth bags and transferred the vegetables into them.</p>
<p>Our composting project is still waiting for our attention. Hopefully in the coming week.</p>
<p>One part of me dreams of a day where I only do mundane, day-to-day work like cooking, washing utensils, cleaning, and more&hellip; if someone were to pay all my bills. Would I really thrive living like that? Would I eventually feel the urge to do something &lsquo;more meaningful&rsquo;? What if I don&rsquo;t create any value or meaning in my life?</p>
<p>What should we make for dinner? For breakfast? It&rsquo;s a daily question&hellip; On Saturday evening, we went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kamla_sewa/?hl=en">Kamla Cafe</a>. During dinner, we were talking about &rsquo;taste&rsquo;. How generation by generation we are losing the taste&hellip; taste of traditional food, fruits, vegetables&hellip; Maggi masala and tomato ketchup are taking over all our taste buds&hellip; things are changing very rapidly. Another part of my being says, &ldquo;Organic stuff is very costly&hellip; it is another scam of capitalism&hellip; Maybe one day I will have my own farm? How can I support a larger ecosystem for sustainable farming practices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of my friends, Chetan (a KA Shala alumnus), is selling milk and other organic products. I have known him for years and can trust the quality of the products he sells.</p>

<p>I bought tickets for a live concert by Papon in Ahmedabad. This will be our first concert experience. I was reading FAQs on the site and realized that we can&rsquo;t take water bottles with us, just because they want to make money by selling packaged water bottles and creating tons of plastic waste. Very disappointing.</p>

<p>Tantra is not black magic :)</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-tantra-">Principles of tantra :</h3>
<ul>
<li>પૃથ્વી પરના જીવન - રંગ, રસ , રૂપ માં જે આનંદ લે છે.. ઉત્સવ બનાવે છે.</li>
<li>જીવનને સમગ્રતા થી સ્વીકાર કરે છે. ઉજાસ ને સ્વીકારે છે.</li>
<li>તંત્ર ડેમોક્રેટિક છે. બધાનો સ્વીકાર છે. જાતિ, જેન્ડર, ધર્મ, અમીર - ગરીબ</li>
<li>વિઘ્નો સાધન છે. યાત્રા સાધ્ય છે. વિઘ્નો સાધના નો ભાગ છે. વિઘ્નો તમને વધુ મજબૂત બનાવે છે.</li>
<li>આ ક્રિયા યોગ છે. અશક્તિ વિનાનો આનંદ છે. આનંદ માટે નીકળ્યા હોય ત્યારે નામ ન પૂછો. જીવનમાં સમગ્રતા થી ભાગ લે.</li>
<li>પળની અંદર સંગ્રતા થી ભાગ લે અને પળને શાશ્વતી બનાવી લે. Live the moment, it will give you sense of eternity.</li>
<li>ઇન્દ્રિયો પારનો રસ્તો ઇન્દ્રિયો માં થઈ ને જાય છે. પરમ નો રસ્તો નગર માં થઈ ને જાય છે. જે માણસ નદી ઓળંગે અને ભીંજાય નહીં એનો કોઈ અર્થ નહીં. હું ભીંજાવ, છોળો ઉછાળતો જાવ..</li>
<li>અસલામતી માં જીવન પાંગરે છે. જીવન ખાતર જુગાર છે. તક મળે તો જુગાર રમી લેવાનો.</li>
<li>જેને શ્રેષ્ઠ જીવવું છે એને શ્રેષ્ઠ દાવ પર પણ મૂકવું પડે છે.</li>
<li>પતન એ ઉત્થાનનો જ ભાગ છે. ભટકવું, ખોવાઈ જવું એ બધું જ.. અંધકાર એ ઉજાસનો જ ભાગ છે.</li>
<li>સ્થૂળ માંથી પસાર થયા વગર સૂક્ષ્મ પમાતુ નથી. જેને દેહનો પ્રેમ નથી કર્યો એ મનના સ્તરે શુ જશે, જે મનના સ્તરે નથી ગયો એ આત્માના સ્તરે શુ જશે.</li>
<li>પૃથ્વીનો સંપર્ક છૂટી જાય એ વૃક્ષ ફળ નથી આપતું. જીવન સાથેનો સંપર્ક અચૂક રાખવો. ચૈતન્યનું લક્ષણ વિસ્તાર છે.</li>
<li>જીવનમાં જે સર્જાય છે.. સંગીત, ચિત્ર, બધાને બે હાથ પહોળા કરીને આવકાર.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tantra-in-day-to-day-life">Tantra in day to day life</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>વધુ ઇન્દ્રિયમય બનો. ઇન્દ્રિયોને ધિક્કારો નહિ. Trust your senses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>મનને પડતું મુકો. આપણને દરેક ક્ષણે મનની જરૂરી નથી. &lsquo;મન મૂકીને ને નાચો&rsquo; When you experience anything with senses live it thoroughly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>અપરાધ ભાવ છોડી દેવાની જરૂર છે. કેટલાક લોકો આંનદ ને જ અપરાધ ગણે છે. દમન ને જવાદો. અપરાધ ભાવ છૂટી જશે તો મનની પકડ ઢીલી થઈ જશે.
leave this : this is good , that is bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જીવનને અભિવ્યક્તિ આપવાની જરૂર છે. મુક્ત રીતે અભિવ્યક્ત કરો. આનંદ જ જીવનનું સાધ્ય, સાધન અને સાધના છે. ત્યાગ વૈરાગ એ પરમ તત્વ નથી. પરમ તત્વ તો રસરાજ છે , રંગ રાજ છે, નટરાજ છે
વિનોબા : એક ઉંમર માં આનંદ પ્રાપ્તિ ધ્યેય હોય છે. પછી આનંદ ની પરિશુધ્ધ ધ્યેય બને. કામ - પ્રેમ - ધ્યાન - પ્રકાશ</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="23rd-to-30th-march-2025-sunday-to-sunday">23rd to 30th March 2025 (Sunday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>This week was hectic again. Meetings, calls, outings and work.
I am having shoulder, neck and lower back pain. It feels like my body hasn&rsquo;t rested for months. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I daily travel 20 to 24km on my Activa. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of stress? It&rsquo;s more painful than I thought. I need to figure out some exercises to get rid of this.</p>
<p>After a year of writing weekly notes, I&rsquo;ve developed some guidelines :</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be selective about what I share publicly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office details remain private, though I can mention celebrations like Holi or special events</li>
<li>No workplace photos</li>
<li>Always get consent before mentioning names or sharing photos of others</li>
<li>Draft everything in private notes first, then curate what goes public</li>
<li>Be aware while writing about issues at home</li>
</ul>
<p>What to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool stuff I&rsquo;m reading, watching, or exploring</li>
<li>My latest experiments and tinkering</li>
<li>Personal projects and how they&rsquo;re coming along</li>
<li>How I&rsquo;m feeling overall</li>
<li>Interesting conversations and stories</li>
<li>Quick updates about life</li>
</ul>
<p>With Monday to Friday consumed by work, I&rsquo;ve decided to dedicate Sunday evenings to this practice. I&rsquo;m setting aside two hours to reflect on the full Monday-Sunday week, even if that means occasionally missing late weekend updates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to value these notes as an important weekly ritual—a chance document and share my journey.</p>
<h3 id="23rd-march---sunday">23rd March - Sunday</h3>
<p>I skipped going to Navjeevan Trust on Sunday. Instead, we (Nidhi, Mom, Mihir) went to watch the Gujarati film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/hi/title/tt23556594/">&lsquo;Fati ne&rsquo;</a>. It was a Horror-Comedy film, a new attempt in Gujarati films. We enjoyed it. I felt that it was a little too long&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="24th-march---monday">24th March - Monday</h3>
<p>We had our first planning meeting for Khojbeen Mandali. We discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are our learning objectives</li>
<li>What is our target age group</li>
<li>How we will document the whole thing</li>
</ul>
<p>Nidhi will take two weekly sessions at Anusandhan Learning Center.</p>
<h3 id="25th-march---tuesday">25th March - Tuesday</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We were looking for a summer intern to work on Khojbeen Mandali, but we didn&rsquo;t get good applications. Mostly freshers have applied. Also, the work is only for two months, the honorarium is low, and it&rsquo;s onsite work, not a remote job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This internship is a good opportunity for someone who is based in Ahmedabad and wants to kickstart their journey in nature education or educational research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="26th-march---wednesday">26th March - Wednesday</h3>
<p>We had a short online meeting with dear friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spidersandthesea/">Chetna</a>. We discussed Khojbeen Mandali. She shared some wonderful insights and ideas from her experience of working with children. I felt very positive and inspired after this meeting.</p>
<h3 id="27th-march---thursday">27th March - Thursday</h3>
<p>I attended an online meeting of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voicesofvishwamitri/">Voice of Vishwamitri</a> (a group of citizens working on environmental and developmental issues of Vadodara city). I wanted to attend the meetings and get involved in action but couldn&rsquo;t attend earlier because of my busy schedule. We need to make a website for the work happening around Vishwamitri river. We had a discussion around the same. I will try to make a basic prototype as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="28th-march---friday">28th March - Friday</h3>
<p>Met dear friend <a href="https://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~malay.dhamelia/">Malay</a> after a long, long time&hellip; almost after 8 years. We chatted about design thinking, aesthetics, wonder, awe, technology, work, education, life and more&hellip; He recently joined IIT G. We will try to meet frequently. This meeting was the highlight of my week.</p>

<h3 id="29th-march---saturday">29th March - Saturday</h3>
<p>We bought a mobile for Mom. She never owned a personal mobile till now (strange, right? But it is real). Instead of ordering online, we went to the nearest mobile shop and bought a Vivo model for 15k. It&rsquo;s a basic smartphone with 8GB RAM + 128GB storage. It&rsquo;s enough for Mom&rsquo;s usage. I didn&rsquo;t do research or even check the price online. I didn&rsquo;t want to go into my overthinking loop. Also, I wanted to give her the touch and feel of the buying process.</p>
<p>Nidhi wanted to do something around documenting bio diversity. We started with identifying and note down trees in our apartment compound. I am really happy that we could start this.</p>
<h3 id="30th-march---sunday">30th March - Sunday</h3>
<p>Mom went back to Padra. Nidhi and I went to drop her at Geeta Mandir bus stop.
After that, we visited Navjeevan Trust Campus. We got a surprise&hellip;
There was a farmers&rsquo; market happening there—&lsquo;Srishti Khedut Hat&rsquo;. Nidhi was super excited to see this. A few alumni of K Shala were also holding a stall there. I was super happy to meet them. We had lunch at their stall.</p>

<p>I was trying to find my old Gujarati textbook from grade 10. I wanted to read stories from it and go on a nostalgia trip, but couldn&rsquo;t find it. The textbook board has changed the textbooks. I want a textbook of grade 10 from 2010.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://amarkathao.in/rasikbhai-raso-varta-in-gujarati/">&lsquo;રસિકભૈ રસો&rsquo;</a> on the internet. I loved reading it&hellip;</p>
<p>We had an online sharing meeting with 2 of our friends who are also working in the nature-science-education field. We shared our current work and life updates&hellip; we decided that we will do this every month. I felt connected and hopeful after the meeting. Thank you Nidhi for initiating this.</p>
<h3 id="current-reading">Current Reading</h3>
<p>Almost finished &ldquo;Electric Train&rdquo; but needed a change of subject, so I started reading &ldquo;Tilor by Dhruv Bhatt&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="overall-mood">Overall mood</h3>
<p>I am so happy to see how Nidhi and Mummy are bonding.
I&rsquo;m grateful that I got the opportunity to spend time with Mummy.
I was very anxious when Mummy was leaving alone for Padra in a bus.</p>

I am living in Thaltej and my parents needed to catch the bus from Geeta Mandir bus stop which is 13km away from here. I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus &amp;amp; local train routes.

Doing composting when there&amp;rsquo;s no balcony in your flat is difficult. It&amp;rsquo;s also time consuming when both of us are working. What are some techniques I can implement? At my home in Padra we used to give food waste to dogs or cows on the street.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aadhvan pointed out that my blog&amp;rsquo;s RSS feed wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. Images weren&amp;rsquo;t loading in the RSS reader because the base URL was &amp;rsquo;localhost:1313&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;rsquo;learningwala.in&amp;rsquo;. I figured that I was using the &amp;lsquo;hugo server&amp;rsquo; command to build the live site, which makes the base URL localhost. I changed my workflow.

<p>It was a roller coaster week, the end part of the week was emotionally demanding.</p>
<ul>
<li>My parents went back to Padra on Sunday. I am living in Thaltej and my parents needed to catch the bus from Geeta Mandir bus stop which is 13km away from here. I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus &amp; local train routes. I was remembering the map man - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Planemad">Arun Ganesh</a></li>
<li>Managing wet waste, especially managing food waste is difficult in city/flat/apartment living. Doing composting when there&rsquo;s no balcony in your flat is difficult. It&rsquo;s also time consuming when both of us are working. What are some techniques I can implement? At my home in Padra we used to give food waste to dogs or cows on the street.</li>
<li>Aadhvan pointed out that my blog&rsquo;s RSS feed wasn&rsquo;t working. Images weren&rsquo;t loading in the RSS reader because the base URL was &rsquo;localhost:1313&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;learningwala.in&rsquo;. I figured that I was using the &lsquo;hugo server&rsquo; command to build the live site, which makes the base URL localhost. I changed my workflow. Now I&rsquo;m using:</li>
</ul>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo --baseURL &#34;https://learningwala.in/&#34; --cleanDestinationDir
python3 -m http.server</code></pre><p>It worked out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, I tried making markdown files from my accounts on Medium.com. I wanted to move all my old blog posts from Medium to my current Hugo site. I used Pandoc to convert HTML to markdown, downloaded all the images, added metadata, and changed image paths with the help of a Python script. Finally, I tried putting all the files in the Hugo folder. Some errors are coming up because of Medium&rsquo;s HTML elements. Now I&rsquo;m frustrated with this. I&rsquo;ll slowly just copy-paste all the posts in markdown. That will be better.</li>
<li>Went for a dinner at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafeaarambh/?hl=en">Aarambh Cafe</a> on sunday evening. Met Bansari.We need to plan meetings with Nidhi, Bansari, Vishnu, and one more with our office team.</li>
<li>At the office, it was a hectic week, mostly meetings &amp; presentations. We celebrated &lsquo;World Storytelling Day&rsquo; on 20th March. All the teammates made impromptu stories and acted out short skits.</li>
<li>Nidhi came back from Kanpur on Thursday. We went to Kamla cafe for dinner. Dadaji is back home from the hospital and on medication.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Now for the sad part of the week. There are extreme family conflicts going on. One more big reminder for me that patriarchy is real. It is very emotionally demanding and a test of life skills. I&rsquo;m grateful that Nidhi and my close friends are with me in this difficult situation. I went to Padra on Friday, and brought mummy with me to ahemdabad. Spent Saturday with Nidhi and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-else">What else?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next month I need to visit Bhopal for a Child Development Course. Need to plan things for the same.</li>
<li>Some more short projects are coming up apart from office work. Need to respond to that.</li>
<li>Need to kick start the work of &lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali&rsquo;</li>
<li>Need to plan camp for Sakha fellows</li>
</ul>
<p>overall mood is ok, sad - angry - frustrated - hopeful - at the moment I am ok. Thanks to Nidhi &amp; mummy.</p>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Still reading Electric Train. Nidhi was telling today that she will continue her &lsquo;Banaras book&rsquo;. I might buy one or two books from Navjeevan on Sunday. I need some variety in reading, but still first preference is &lsquo;Lalit Nibandh&rsquo; - essays and second preference is short stories or poems :)</p>
<p><strong>I am looking forward to this :</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;9th-to-15-march-2025-sunday-to-saturday&#34;&gt;9th to 15 March 2025 (Sunday to Saturday)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;9th-march-sunday&#34;&gt;9th March, Sunday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I had a talk with &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/week-14-2024/&#34;&gt;Konarak&lt;/a&gt; about the problem I&amp;rsquo;m facing with my website/blog. I want to add more photos, but GitHub Pages has only a 1GB repo size limit. I was considering setting up a Raspberry Pi or an Oracle server (similar to Amazon S3). Konarak suggested trying Cloudflare Pages instead. I created a project on Cloudflare Pages and found it surprisingly simple. Initially, I was manually creating my Hugo site on my local machine and copying only the &amp;lsquo;Public&amp;rsquo; folder to CF Pages. I wondered if there was a way to deploy directly from the command line. My first attempt wasn&amp;rsquo;t successful, so I had a short call with Konarak who helped me set it up properly. Now I can deploy my site with just a single command line - much more efficient than writing multiple git commands. This website now lives on CF Pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;  &lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;picture&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_15334863afe29ca1.webp&#34; type=&#34;image/webp&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_676e7a8564ccafc2.jpg&#34; type=&#34;image/jpeg&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;img&#xA;        src=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_676e7a8564ccafc2.jpg&#34;&#xA;        alt=&#34;cf pages&#34;&#xA;        loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&#xA;        decoding=&#34;async&#34;&#xA;        width=&#34;800&#34;&#xA;      /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/picture&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;      &lt;figcaption&gt;Github Pages v/s Cloud Flare Pages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://adhavansivaraj.xyz/&#34;&gt;Adhavan&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; weekly note and noticed he used a grid format for displaying images. I liked it and tried implementing the same thing on my blog. It took some time to figure out because I was already using shortcode for image handling and optimization. Using shortcode for both grid and image optimization together was challenging. I tried different AI tools to solve this problem - Claude, ChatGPT and Co-pilot. Co-pilot gave the simplest solution on the first attempt. ChatGPT was the worst, while Claude was average. They kept giving complex solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Watched the Gujarati film &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8982436/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Ventilator&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on a Marathi film with the same name. It was a wonderful watch. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was officially available on YouTube. Thanks to the algorithm for making my Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;10th-march-monday&#34;&gt;10th March, Monday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It was an office colleague&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so we went out for lunch with the whole team.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I had a call with Earth Educator Fellow Vimal who runs an organization called WildED. We discussed nature education, program design approaches, how to approach schools, and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I explored how to incorporate Gujarati fonts on my blog. I currently use Inconsolata fonts for English text. For Gujarati, I discovered a GitHub repository called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/samyakbhuta/chhapkaam&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Chhapkam&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, developed by my friends Samyak Bhuta and Kartik Mistry. With Co-pilot&amp;rsquo;s assistance, I figured out the process of uploading these fonts and configuring them to activate whenever I write Gujarati content in my blog posts or pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;11th-march-tuesday&#34;&gt;11th March, Tuesday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bansari (friend/colleague from office) took me to meet her friend Vishnu, who works at American India Foundation as a science educator. We talked about life &amp;amp; education (what else can I talk about!!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;13th-march-thursday&#34;&gt;13th March, Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We played Holi at the office. I&amp;rsquo;ve never played Holi at my previous workplaces and really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h4 id="10th-march-monday">10th March, Monday</h4>
<ul>
<li>It was an office colleague&rsquo;s birthday, so we went out for lunch with the whole team.</li>
<li>I had a call with Earth Educator Fellow Vimal who runs an organization called WildED. We discussed nature education, program design approaches, how to approach schools, and more.</li>
<li>I explored how to incorporate Gujarati fonts on my blog. I currently use Inconsolata fonts for English text. For Gujarati, I discovered a GitHub repository called <a href="https://github.com/samyakbhuta/chhapkaam">&lsquo;Chhapkam&rsquo;</a>, developed by my friends Samyak Bhuta and Kartik Mistry. With Co-pilot&rsquo;s assistance, I figured out the process of uploading these fonts and configuring them to activate whenever I write Gujarati content in my blog posts or pages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11th-march-tuesday">11th March, Tuesday</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bansari (friend/colleague from office) took me to meet her friend Vishnu, who works at American India Foundation as a science educator. We talked about life &amp; education (what else can I talk about!!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="13th-march-thursday">13th March, Thursday</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We played Holi at the office. I&rsquo;ve never played Holi at my previous workplaces and really enjoyed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me &amp; Nidhi had a online meeting with Tanaya (from nature classroom). She is developing assessment tool to measure the impact of nature based learning intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched a film called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7790898/">Gujju Bhai - Most Wanted</a>&rsquo;. It was a fun watch. Again, thanks to my YouTube algorithm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="14th-march-friday">14th March, Friday</h4>
<ul>
<li>My parents came to Ahmedabad. Papa bought a second-hand Activa for me &amp; Nidhi. They drove from Vadodara to Ahmedabad. In the evening, we went to Palladium mall (we all wanted to spend time at the same place, and the mall was just 20 steps away from our home, so we decided to go there&hellip; it was fun discussing brands, packaging design, and fashion with papa).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="15th-march-saturday">15th March, Saturday</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Papa and I went to my office on the Activa. I wanted to check if I remembered the way. Though I wasn&rsquo;t confident, I surprisingly reached there very smoothly without looking at a map. I realized that now I have personal mobility. I&rsquo;ve never owned a vehicle before, mostly using public transport/Uber/Ola/Rapido. Most of my houses and workplaces were nearby, but now with my office 10km away and living in Ahmedabad—a happening city with drama, events, and literature-related talks—having a vehicle will be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a heat wave going on in Ahmedabad. Luckily, I go to the office early in the morning and return after 5pm, so I skip the worst hours, but it&rsquo;s still very hot and this is just the beginning of summer. I&rsquo;m very grateful to have a living space with AC and happy that I could offer air conditioning to my parents. Environmentally, AC is the worst thing to have, but when you live in a city apartment, it&rsquo;s difficult to choose alternatives. For most years in my career, I worked in remote villages. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m being pulled into city life&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am grateful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a new vehicle</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The opportunity to work with researchers. Currently at the office, I&rsquo;m involved in pilot activities with children where we test different hypotheses. There are proper observers/research associates documenting the whole process. I wish to move more toward the research side now. At Khojbeen (our nature-project-theater based learning initiative that Nidhi and I are nurturing), we&rsquo;re also partnering with Nature Classroom and hopefully with Srivi to research our intervention. <a href="https://www.sriviliveshere.com/">Srivi</a> is a wonderful researcher, artist, and educator. I would like to work with her on environmental aesthetics.</li>
<li>Reading a lot about aesthetic sense development lately. This might help me develop activity modules or conduct sessions. I wish to hold a session with my office team on this topic. Taking a session is the best motivation to study things in depth.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="updates-about-khojbeen-">Updates about khojbeen :</h4>
<ul>
<li>We had a meeting with Tanaya about assessment tool</li>
<li>We are in touch with srivi, we are planning to do research about aesthetic sense development in children through nature based intervention.</li>
<li>We published an invitation for summer internship positions with our team. We received a diverse range of interesting applications from PhD students all the way to 10th grade students. We&rsquo;re specifically looking for someone who is based in Ahmedabad, has a genuine interest in nature education, and is enthusiastic about working with children.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="1st-to-8th-march-2025-saturday-to-saturday">1st to 8th March 2025 (Saturday to Saturday)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Week was super hectic, new job, new home, new city :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me and Nidhi are slowly settling down here in ahemdabad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We came here on 29th and I joined new workplace from 3rd March. so we got some time to settle the our stuff, figure out breakfast, lunch places,vegetable - fruit vendors, bought some grocery - kitchen utensils. living in big city is difficult. If I stay in vadodra I can go to mangal bazar or local market of padra and get the stuff. Here it was difficult to find out local market. You need to surrender to places like Dmart or blinkit. I am very very grateful to Nidhi, she did all the setup for kitchen, rooms.. made the place homelike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>during Saturday and Sunday :</p>
<ul>
<li>I watched amazing documentary called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiL4ply2f44">Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai</a>&rsquo; based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Kumar_Shukla">Vinod Kumar Shukla</a>&rsquo;s life &amp; work.</li>
<li>Went to Navjeevan Trust Campus after long time. Explored their new book store called &lsquo;Hridaykunj&rsquo;. Got 2 new books. Banaras Dairy by Vivek Desai (English translation), Electric Train (Gujarati) by Geeta Nayak. Both the books were in my list to buy from long time. I bought banaras dairy in english so Nidhi can also read. She is from UP but never get chance to visit banaras, now a days she is making efforts to know and connect with her city - state. I was keen to read banaras dairy in gujarati, I was in doubt if I will understand and feel the content in english or not. Nidhi did loud reading of one of chapters. It was good&hellip; I can visualize.. accept when some unknown words come in..</li>
<li>We also had dinner at &lsquo;Karma Cafe&rsquo; at Navjeevan Trust Campus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work is going well. We have young energetic - learning oriented team. I will need some more time to figure out transport. My office is 12km away from home. Right now I using repido bike service. Everyday I am meeting new new characters of repido bike drivers. I will write about it in detail on some other day. For coming back I take lift from team members.. papa bought second hand activa for us, it is in vadodra right now. We need to figure out how to bring that here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got tagged by <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">Thej</a> to answer some questions about blogging - <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/a-challenge-of-blog-questions/">Why blog?</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Published some material on <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/aesthetics-sense-develoment-/">aesthetics sense development</a> &amp; <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/panchkosh/">Panchkosh / IKS</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on saturday 8th march me &amp; nidhi completed one month of our marriage. Nidhi&rsquo;s mom reminded us :) most of the time we forget that we are &ldquo;married&rdquo;. Nidhi order noodles and choco lava to celebrate the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s dadaji got admitted in hospital for second time in last 15 days. on saturday late night, nidhi took flight for Lucknow to visit home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was tagged by Thejesh on <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/2025/02/27/a-challenge-of-blog-questions/">a series of questions that he had answered about blogging</a>.</p>
<p>I am so happy to be back in blogosphere. I have discovered many interesting people through Thej&rsquo;s weekly notes &amp; blogring. I am also trying to contact them to know more about their work and interesting projects they are doing. Thank you Thej.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>I started blogging long back in 2012. At that time it was a fascination to understand the technology, while using wordpress it was &rsquo;need of connect with new people&rsquo; (I was 17yr old exploring / figuring my career - studies - life ).</p>
<p><strong>current &lsquo;Why&rsquo; :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documenting and sharing my work and life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Till a year ago I was mostly blogging in Gujarati language. Now I am blogging in English so I can connect and share with more people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through weekly notes I try to document updates about what is happening in my life. What am I reading, watching, learning, doing, my side projects. I don&rsquo;t share much about my full time work / organization. I tried sharing about previous org, but they somehow read it and HR called me and asked to delete the post. I can not mention in my weekly notes about what is happening in my project or team. Fair enough, so now I write about it in private note and talk more about my side projects. For me working in education / with children is not like a job. It is like a way of my life, an integral part of my life so I want to document - talk - share about everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to write a blog post category called &lsquo;Update&rsquo; in my previous blog but after reading Thej&rsquo;s weekly notes, last year I have started writing in &lsquo;weekly note&rsquo; format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from weekly notes, I have three major blog post categories :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Filed notes :</strong> (learning experience with children / notes from session / classroom / workshop / facilitation)</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources :</strong> (research papers, videos, any kind of material related to education, child development, PBL, Experiential learning and other interest areas)</li>
<li><strong>Other :</strong> opinion / short note / comments about technology / education / philosophy / anything</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I also host my published articles, creative writing and my portfolio of work on the same site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?</strong></p>
<p>I have used many different platforms: blogspot, wordpress, php site, medium, used instagram for blogging..<a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/my-blogging-journey/">Here you can read my blogging journey</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I am using the Hugo site hosted on github pages.</p>
<p>I have realized that my site is going to be image heavy and github is not suitable for that. There is limit to host your site on GH Pages. Since the last few days I have been trying to figure out the feature proof solution for the same. Friends suggested different options : go for CDN &amp; Image storing on cloudinary / S3 , Ghost, Blot, self host on pi, build hugo site in local machine and host public folder on VM.</p>
<p>I want a solution where I can put all my data in one place (not like images in different place and text files are in different place). I don&rsquo;t want to lock in, I want to control my own data. I am also ready to pay 3-4k annually.</p>
<p>I am convinced to go for the last option. Let&rsquo;s see when I get a chance to set up and how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?</strong></p>
<p>I write all my posts, edit my pages on sublime text. Friends suggested VS Code but I am still in love with sublime.</p>
<p><strong>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly I publish immediately. Sometimes I make drafts of weekly notes, add to it throughout the week and write the final version during Friday / weekend. Sometimes I use a paper journal to note down points.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite post on your blog?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/i-never-bought-a-new-laptop/">I never bought a new laptop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From my Gujarati blog :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/p/5a5a882f792a">સંવેદનશીલતાના પ્રેમની કેળવણી</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/p/1779a6248277">facilitation બોલે તો ?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I am planning to shift my blog on S3 kind of server. So I can publish more images without worrying about github limits.</p>
<p>Apart from that I need to make a workflow where :</p>
<ul>
<li>When I do a session with children, Write a post + publish photos in the &lsquo;field notes&rsquo; category. Put that link in a page called documentation with date and meta data. Duplicate that on linkedin + Instagram</li>
<li>Maintain &lsquo;Now&rsquo; page + archive, add side projects in documentation page. Make documentation page as master archive page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who’s next?</strong></p>
<p>I am tagging <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik Mistry</a>.</p>

We are newlyweds, so family and friends are inviting us for lunch and dinner at their place. We enjoy going to friends&amp;rsquo; places, but at relatives&amp;rsquo; places, Nidhi needs to be ready in a saree or kurta with ornaments and all. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it, so it was tough for her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On 22nd Feb: we went to Mitali ben&amp;rsquo;s place. We enjoyed chatting with Mitali Ben&amp;rsquo;s mom and Jagat Bhai. It&amp;rsquo;s a family.. every minute cracking jokes happens.. very light environment, cricket, movies, puns, and more. I wish my family become like this. It gives you mental peace that everything is ok, we will handle it. At my place, it was like war was happening, strict, silent, needful talk only..anyway..&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w9.2025/mituben.jpeg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Description of the image&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Mitu ben&amp;rsquo;s place&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>On 25th Feb: we went to Anushree&rsquo;s place to have lunch. Anushree is a new friend from Vadodra. She contacted me for her research on karma &amp; shradha. Me &amp; Nidhi both participated in the research.. and became good friends.</p>
<p>She is from a Marathi family living in Vadodara. We enjoyed talking to her ajji and visiting her small garden in the compound. She is an upcycling expert, she made many interesting things for trash.</p>

<p>On 26th Feb: on Shivaratri, Nidhi and mummy-papa visited our community temple in the Narmada district called Nandikeshwar Mahadev. The roads were very bad and it was 3hrs journey. Everyone was tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we visited my mama&rsquo;s place for dinner (we visited 3 relative&rsquo;s places in one day.. it was overwhelming)</p>

<li>In between all these we did packing for our next move. One day mummy also came and helped us. It was very very helpful. It could take a longer time for me and Nidhi if she didn&rsquo;t come.</li>

<p>28th Feb: I &amp; Nidhi finally moved to Ahmedabad on Friday. Ravi Bhai offered us his flat to use for some time. So we can find a proper place to live. Finding a house in a big cities is a tough job. We both are very greatful to him.
Nidhi doesn&rsquo;t like flats/apartments, she likes old-style houses with open spaces, gardens, and all. I also like those but it&rsquo;s a luxury in the city.</p>
<p>Now a new journey is starting, finding a home, finding a workplace for Nidhi, finding healthy food options (we both have stomach issues) finding a cook, setting up stuff in a home, and transport options.. should we buy a scooter or not.. many actions are in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After reaching Ahmedabad. First setup after reaching to Ahmedabad  :</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="25th-to-31st-jan-2025-saturday-to-friday">25th to 31st Jan 2025 (Saturday to Friday)</h4>
<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>

<li>tried osm mapping</li>
<li>did washing machine repairing at home with papa and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFSsmjuscyh/?img_index=1">session - Biology of Money in the morning</a></li>
<li>wrote summary about session published <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/biology-of-money/">blog post</a> and my prep note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>watched arun ganesh&rsquo;s interview</li>
<li>spent time to study adhavana&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>I tried OSM Go app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had short call with Thejesh GN about how to do survey of biodiversity / tree mapping.
he shared tool called kobo tool box (<a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">https://www.kobotoolbox.org/</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vidit came from the canada for few months. He is super confused and stressed about going back to canada.He is analyzing that should he stay in india and do the job or should he go back to canda and do hardwork to save money and come back.. it&rsquo;s classic immigration conundrum. We had long discussion, we went to vadodra, had lunch at nice gujarati thali restaurant called Kathivadi Darbar - Alkapuri. After that we went to buy Monitor screen for me. It was a long pending task to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we bought refurbished Dell E2421HN 24inch monitor in 5k and logitech wireless mouse and keyboard (K275) . I was very confusing during the shopping, I was comparing online price, which brand and technology to buy and everything&hellip; finally i took a plunge. it&rsquo;s nice quality not very slim and attractive like what I see online but it is decent. I am trying this new keyboard. It&rsquo;s a mechanical keyboard. After using thinkpad&rsquo;d keyboard it is difficult to shift to any other keyboard. let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I think I will like it in sometime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spent time in researching about the monitor. It is my habit. Which now I don&rsquo;t like.
I keep researching and justifying my decision. In this case I keep justifying my step to not buying IPS monitor because it was costly (8k) and I don&rsquo;t need it because I am not doing gaming or graphic designing work. But when ever I read that IPS gives good color accuracy and it is good for eyes. At that time my mind goes mad and it tells me to go back to shop and give back the monitor and buy another one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This confusion is very interesting. I am experimenting with it for low stack environment so I can learn and apply it in other situation also. I read about e - ink screens which seems best for the low eye strain and also for distraction free work.
People are making <a href="https://www.modos.tech/">e- ink monitors</a> and <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/">tabs</a>. Some people are trying gray scale on their existing monitors and phones. I also tried gray scale on my ubuntu device. It took some time to find out right tool to do system wide gray scale. Thanks to chat GPT. It was fun experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this whole thing is about how brain works. How we are taking a decisions. What we prioritize and why. I was remembering Paras Chopra&rsquo;s mental models. Also thinking about cognitive basis. finally I had chat with chat GPT which gave me some peace :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abhijit was in Vadodra to take session at oasis. I went to vadodara to meet him. We had a lunch at kathiwadi darbar. This is second time I am going to kathiwadi darbar in same week. After lunch we went to visit Aditya&rsquo;s maker space &lsquo;Forrest of us&rsquo;. They are doing very nice work. I am happily jalousie. At that day they were working on wast management of Vadodra marathon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also return the monitor I have bought. I had talk with suchakra and he suggested to buy new <a href="https://www.amazon.in/LG-IPS-sRGB-Height-Adjust-Display/dp/B0BRQT57RC/ref=mp_s_a_1_10?crid=1H4NH4KLPIHXP&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._T_qxcACiBpvKYmQSvgLsW4s0T3usIbvmqF8SRaqTAZgmWnAot7QBFC4w_L_7Yk126yZcmZo6wC6F2N4IFh4xu99ugCCcUuPqgybu-fdOhIPmTlBT3wDNqCPncem5er2gaNCjJlSokyZNYZY3G494MUKaWlimUjKyarCJZYXNvLuPohREB4SqZtimtiIB8pG5HbomJmwj40-e08oBVqQ6A.3w1owtm-qWWQ-HYXuIYhe21SIgrTQyiXSvKTTYbZyuc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=benq&#43;qhd&#43;monitor&#43;24&#43;inches&amp;nsdOptOutParam=true&amp;qid=1738175044&amp;sprefix=benq&#43;qhd&#43;monitor%2Caps%2C459&amp;sr=8-10">LG QHD monitor</a> which is good for reading, writing, coding. So I ordered at same shop in Vadodra. Suchakra also sponsored part of the total amount of the monitor as a marriage gift :) Very thoughtful gift&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got msg Radhika from Balgokulam. They are ready to hire my as learning facilitator. I was waiting for this confirmation since last 2 months. Finally it came. Now we need to finalize where should we go ? Kanisa or ahemdabd ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in last weekly note I have written that we will not go for jashdan and join kanisa but now game is changed.</p>
<p>→ Stability &amp; social life : ahemdabad is ok ok city. We can come to vadodara in two hours.
→ Finance : salary + grant<br>
→ Stimulation at work / meaningful work : it&rsquo;s seems interesting. Nature education for kindergarten children + I can continue sakha fellowship and local khoji work in vadodra. I can learn research part. It will be corporate style setting but I need to be flexible.
→ Nidhi&rsquo;s work / working together :  she can come to balgokulam, she can join anusandhan ngo , we can find new places</p>
<p>we had a long call with Mitali ben. She also suggested to go ahemdabd.
Now I need to think about winding up DEFY work in march and find out home and everything in ahemdabd. Still I am confuse, unsure, let&rsquo;s see.. universe will take care.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary-of-todays-session">Summary of Today’s Session</h2>
<h3 id="we-are-not-very-different-from-other-species">We are not very different from other species.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fungi do trading, we do too.</li>
<li>Animals hunt and gather, and so do we.</li>
<li>Animals signal for mating and choose the best partner to carry their genes forward. We do that too.</li>
<li>Animals compete, and we do the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our body and brain perceive only a small part of reality, just like the example of a Herring Gull bird focusing on a red dot. We too often see just the &ldquo;red dot&rdquo; in many situations. This is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We watch Bollywood movies (which mostly contain violence and romance).</li>
<li>We eat junk food (caught in the dopamine loop).</li>
<li>We get alarmed when politicians say another community will destroy our existence – we get triggered.</li>
<li>We know we can make healthy food at home, but we still order from outside.</li>
<li>We get influenced by &ldquo;artificial needs,&rdquo; like the idea that we need to buy certain brands to look cool. These aren’t real needs; they’re socially constructed to benefit companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-we-do-about-this">What can we do about this?</h3>
<p>Signals from our DNA aren’t always good for us. Take surgery, for example. When you undergo surgery, your brain signals pain because it perceives it as a threat. But we use anesthesia to stop the pain and perform surgery for a better future.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes we need to ignore signals from our genes and think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I really need this?</li>
<li>Do I really need to compete?</li>
<li>Is there really a scarcity, or do we have enough?</li>
<li>Should I accept everything that comes from the past or tradition without questioning it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our DNA might tell us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy more</li>
<li>Fight because they’re &ldquo;destroying&rdquo; us</li>
<li>Earn more because we’re not safe</li>
</ul>
<p>But we need to ask: Really?</p>
<h3 id="our-nature-can-also-help-us-grow">Our Nature Can Also Help Us Grow</h3>
<p>For example, curiosity, learning, and creation are part of our nature. So, let’s use that to create things that solve real-world problems. This will give us both money and fulfillment.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Money isn’t inherently bad. It’s a system, a mutually agreed-upon concept made by humans to run society. However, like any complex system, it has its flaws.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-money-status-and-people-connected">Why are Money, Status, and People Connected?</h3>
<p>Biologically, having more resources means more safety and freedom. Since money provides resources, people tend to respect and give status to those who have it. But this is like focusing only on the red dot – we shouldn’t judge people or choices based solely on money. There are many other factors to consider.</p>
<p>Whether you’re choosing a partner or a career, looking only at money, fame, or status might lead to a downfall. So, think about other aspects too.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="we-give-irrational-value-to-many-things-and-chase-after-them">We Give Irrational Value to Many Things and Chase After Them</h2>
<p>We place irrational value on luxurious bikes, cars, watches, phones, and houses. They become status symbols, and people work hard just to achieve these symbols. This is completely irrational.</p>
<p>But we can change our status symbols. Imagine if these were society’s new status symbols:</p>
<h3 id="signs-of-a-healthy-wealthy-and-wise-society">Signs of a Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise Society</h3>
<p><em>(Shared by Manish Jain, inspired by Bhutan’s GNH)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Walking and bicycling are the primary modes of transport.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes (at least 10 different species) can walk freely in neighborhoods, feeling safe and respected.</li>
<li>Every neighborhood has at least 100 diverse plant and tree species, including organic fruits, wild foods, and medicinal plants, and the soil is rich with microorganisms.</li>
<li>People spend at least one hour a day drinking herbal tea with friends.</li>
<li>Fresh bread is made and eaten daily using freshly ground flour, often two to three times per day.</li>
<li>Men feel comfortable crying in front of others and are encouraged to share their feelings openly. Daily human touch is encouraged.</li>
<li>There’s no need for excessive security measures like CCTV, security guards, barbed wire fencing, or high military spending. People don’t have to lock their doors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-your-indicators-of-happiness">What Are Your Indicators of Happiness?</h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-society">What Makes a Good Society?</h2>
<p>A good society is where everyone feels respected and has the opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Today, on Republic Day, let’s take a pause…</p>
<p>The five basic constitutional values of India, as outlined in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Justice</strong> – Social, economic, and political justice for all citizens, ensuring fairness and equality in society.</li>
<li><strong>Liberty</strong> – Freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, protecting individual rights and personal freedoms.</li>
<li><strong>Equality</strong> – Equal status and opportunity for all, ensuring that everyone is treated without discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</li>
<li><strong>Fraternity</strong> – Promoting a sense of brotherhood and unity among citizens, ensuring dignity for the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.</li>
<li><strong>Secularism</strong> – Ensuring that the state treats all religions equally and does not promote or favor any particular religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>These values form the foundation of India&rsquo;s democratic and inclusive system, ensuring the rights and freedoms of its citizens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assignment-for-everyone">Assignment for Everyone</h2>
<p>Think about these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there such a difference in the salaries of a farmer and a software engineer? Both work hard, right?</li>
<li>What would happen if we gave the same salary to every profession?</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a short note about these two questions and share it with us within the next 10 days.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out to us if you want to discuss anything.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Me and Nidhi are thinking about giving proper name and visual identity to our nature education work. Learningwala is there but nidhi is feeling that, it is my brand and my work, she is not feeling that she is part of it. So we have decided to create something new which we both can hold and nurture.</p>
<p>I was thinking about different names.. KhojBeen Mandali suck to my mind. Nidhi also liked it. I started reaching out to people seeking help in visual identity. Rachita called me and gave some ideas about how to start. I had a chat with Ipsa Jain, Ashra, Nipun Prabhakar, Jinal, Chaitali and few other folks about the same.</p>

<p><strong>Overall mood and other things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall I am happy. Work at DEFY is going well.</li>
<li>I am happy that my and nidhi&rsquo;s friends are coming to our wedding</li>
<li>After eliminating all the options we have decided to go to <a href="https://www.ntpatelhighschool.org/">Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</a> from march. <a href="https://gopaldham.org/">Gopaldham</a> option is still open, today morning I had call with Varun. He is ready to accommodate both of us with salary we are expecting. The only thing is it is very remote area and we will feel alone. Here mitali ben is there, vadodra is near by so it will work out. I told varun that we will meet after 15th feb. We will visit the school so we can get idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly we will take a risk and go to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :)</p>

<p>they were student of alternative school near rajkot / chotila calle &lsquo;K shala&rsquo;. I use to do BA sociology from surastra university around 2017. During that time I use to visit this school. Bharat came to my place when I was working in Bhuj. I was so happy to see them after so many years. Our relationship was not like teacher - students. We are friends. I am so happy that they are now working with children and trying to create environment which they got during k shala. They also shared the updates about other students that they are doing well in their respective fields and some of them are getting married soon.</p>

<p>Bharat and Dhara are going to work at shishukunj foundation, Bhuj. They are going to work with children from gov schools. Me &amp; Nidhi were thinking to visit them and do some nature education work with them. I felt that they are thinking limited scope of work like doing games and art activity with children. We can do lot more. We will talk to them. I it just thought, I never seen them working so I might be wrong.</p>

I tried to capture all our activities in one photo report - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canva.com/design/DAGaq8utmtg/O439oGkID5vYzoAcNmCFkQ/view?utm_content=DAGaq8utmtg&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;amp;utm_source=uniquelinks&amp;amp;utlId=h2c229f4669#1&#34;&gt;Gulmohar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/2024-reflections/&#34;&gt;2024 year end reflections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to work with young people for so long. I wanted to design fellowship kind of program where they get opportunity to work on real life projects, travel, meet people outside of their circle. Finally it worked out. Friends from sai&amp;rsquo;s angel foundation + Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are working on something called sakha fellowship. We are launching it on 12th Jan. I spent time on developing all the ideas related to it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My health went down, fever, low blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am getting married on 4th Feb. Preparations are going in full swing. On 5th Jan relatives are going to come at home to write invitation card (Kankotri in Gujarati) so I helped parents to prepare for the same.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I did calculation of all funding and other money I have and how much I utilize in what.&#xA;Didn&amp;rsquo;t get proper calculation for salary money (money apart from grant).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &amp;lsquo;Marriage&amp;rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.. but still I will try to put what ever is coming in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>In Feb 2024 we did <a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/LZQcbKVxaVXu1iZ9SvLeau2F">&lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo;</a> exhibition. It was a culmination of 3 -4 month long journey with Imapana (student from BeMe school). I am very grateful to BeMe for giving me this space to experiment like this. It was long time wish to do this type of work with children. I am planning to write article on pedagogical aspect of this experiment.</p>

<p>In Feb I have visited Chennai beach to see turtle nesting with Harshit (student from BeMe). <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">It was very new experience for me</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I met many inspiring &amp; intersting people this year - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C21GbryIQ97/?img_index=1">Jane Sahi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">Arun V</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C51RvfvoGYh/?img_index=1">Anand Chitipothu</a>, <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/">Paras Chopra</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wowsig/?hl=en">Aakansha Gaur</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C59-MIZIeKj/">Nature Classroom team</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C14ocvOIbaO/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">ATREE Water workshop</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2gbwwFItFS/?img_index=1">Sci Gallary BLR taeam</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6Dvv9yoMh1/">Anish &amp; Junuka</a></p>

<h3 id="moving-back-to-vadodara">Moving back to Vadodara</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Left bangalore and moved to Vadodra : I shifted to BLR on Dec 2022 to join BeMe and spend more time with Nidhi (She was studying in Azim Premji University that time). After finishing MA in education at APU, Nidhi took job at org called ThinkTac - Science education company. She didn&rsquo;t liked the nature of work. It was more working in content development side rather than facilitation / working with children or teacher. She was more interested in facilitation that time. She left the job in 4 months (Jun 2023 - Sep 2023). She took break of 7 months (Oct 2023 - Apr 2024 ) during the break she did small projects like helping me in setting up the time exhibition, book translation for nature classroom, etc.</p>
<p>After one point we both felt that we need to move somewhere else to work. Because joing BeMe was not the option for her that time. If she gets the job somewhere in BLR, everything is very far and expensive. I never wanted to leave BeMe. It was my dream job. But nothing was working out.</p>
<p>We tried shifting to Pune. I got the job at Anubhuti learning center. Similar alternative space like beme. But Nidhi was not getting appropriate job. So we canceled the option.</p>
<p>During that time parents were encouraging me to come back to vadodra, they were feeling lonely, their health were not ok, we wanted to be around them so we can take our marriage conversation forward. So we decided that let&rsquo;s go back to vadodara.</p>
<p>Some how it worked out. I had a talk with Ravi bhai and he offered 1 year grant. I got job as content developer at Pratham Foundation.
Aaakansha also offered 1 year - Escape Velosity Grant to us. So with all of support, we came to Vadodra on 30th April 2024.</p>
<p>Nidhi also got <a href="https://bhoomicollege.org/teach-for-nature-fellowship-fellows">&lsquo;Teach for Nature Fellowship&rsquo;</a> to work in Nature Education in Vadodara.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement---mihir--nidhi">Engagement - Mihir &amp; Nidhi</h3>
<ul>
<li>First thing we did after moving back was event of our formal engagement with friends and family members. It was tough.
10 people coming from Kanpur in train staying in small town like padra, managing whole event, managing everyone&rsquo;s ego - emotions - expectations.. it was tough for me and nidhi both. But we did it. We came out of our comfort zone and did it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiest moment was when our friends came to the event and stood with us.</p>
<p><img src="/2024/sagai.JPG" alt="Friends at Engagement "></p>

<li>Nidhi rented out flat and started working with Rameshwari ben and Amit bhai.</li>

<h3 id="work-at-pratham">Work at Pratham</h3>
<p>Pratham was roller coaster experience. In the beginning I was very happy that I got remote job so I can stay in vadodra and also do other work. Secondly it was content development job in environment domain. My team was producing videos for topics like climate change, plastic literacy and more. There was interesting project called creativity club in our account too. Where we need to develop prompt videos for children age 10+ yrs to foster their creativity, collaboration, communication and problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Overall work was interesting but I could sustain there for more than 7 months.</p>
<p>Few reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was remote team with large scale, deadline driven project. Working in high peace environment with remote team was new experience for me. I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to team and the factory approach which we were using for content development. I felt very disconnected from ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my skills were not very good for this type of work environment. I mostly worked with children or teachers. On ground. Never worked with canva - excel - chatgpt. So it was good learning.</p>
<p>I first time wrote script for videos
I first time made posters &amp; videos on canva
I was part of team of the project at this scale for first time where my content goes to thousands of children pan India.</p>
<p>I learnt how to make content for creativity and other 21st century skills. Mainly we were using design thinking activities, replicating already available activities in our format. But making it useful for large scale project is also good learning.</p>
<p>I learnt about how large scale orgs works, I learnt little bit about partnerships and funding</p>
<p>best part of my work was coordinating with nature educators from all over India to nature education camps with children at different location. It was good that I already had network of people in the domain.</p>
<p>I left pratham on 15th Nov 2024. Took few days back break and joined <a href="https://projectdefy.org/">Project DEFY</a> (25th Nov 2024) as subject matter expert - self directed learning. It&rsquo;s 3 months remote assignment.</p>
<p>during pratham days I first time experienced serious anxiety. Stress. Somehow it was very chill for other team members. But I was not handle constant stress, constant communication &amp; coordination.. it was very bad phase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-work--expectations-from-home">Finding Work &amp; expectations from home</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aakansha and Ravi bhai offered the grant for the one year. I left the pratham so now we didn&rsquo;t have any backup for money.
most of the pratham&rsquo;s salary is going to be used in marriage event (all the shopping, jewellery and all). Nidhi has some money coming through fellowship but that also she was not able to continue because multiple things going on at home. so we reached out to all social media, all the friends with the <a href="https://learningwala.in/ourneeds/">request</a>. we got many calls from alternative schools from south, many orgs, individuals.</p>
<p>we are very very grateful to all the people who reached out to us with offerings. People who connected us with other people, people who thought about us.</p>
<p>Because of my family situation we need to stay near to vadodra / ahemdabad. My parents wants us to stay near to them. Because of their loneliness, because of their health, because their insecurities , because they feel socially confident when we are around.. for whatever reasons they are not happy about we leaving vadodra and go far from them.</p>
<p>one more aspect to it is they want Nidhi to be house wife kind of person. Helping my mother to do all the work, not taking independent work. My home is based in Patriarchy system. so to stay far from it we need to find work-stay option where we are not very near to them and not very far.</p>
<p>This year very big chunk of my time went to fight and manage the balance of our values and expectations from family. Friends helped me a lot in this. thank you rameshwari ben, mitali ben, many other friends.</p>
<p>Now we are stuck, we have very limited option at vadodra / ahemdabad for meaningful and well paid work. After eliminating many options right now we left with very few :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :</strong> Ravi bhai is willing to continue grant next year also, Aakansha also offered that if I can help her in some admin work of &rsquo;escape velocity grant&rsquo; she can offer grant for one more year. With this assurance we can move to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school 2hrs far from vadodra and work there. Next year we can again search for grant. (Inlaks Grants, The Circle incubation) Also we can find out some part time / remote work if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> we can work directly with children, we can develop nature education curriculum / do action reasecrh. Nidhi and me can work on our health, we can also be near to my family. We can also work with other orgs in Vadodra because it is just 2hrs away.</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> Instability of funding, we might feel lonely sometime in village.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gopaldham learning center :</strong> it is an Ashramshala in Jashdan near rajkot / chotila. 5hrs from vadodra. they are looking for school leader kind of person.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> there are only 70 children, we will get full freedom to do meaningful work. We both will get work. Good payment also</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> this is new place. We don&rsquo;t know the founders and team personally. No friends, we will feel lonely. We need to leave work we have started in vadodra</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Balgokulam :</strong> it is an early childhood research org based in ahemdabad.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro :</strong> good salary. My role will direct working with children and researching about early childhood curriculum. so new learning opportunity. we can come to vadodara when ever is needed, it is just 2hrs</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> new set up don&rsquo;t know what exactly my role looks like. It is new org started in 2023 so don&rsquo;t know the future. We will need to find job for nidhi.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Eklavya, Bhopal :</strong> with Aakansha&rsquo;s funding we can go eklavya bhopal and start working there with libraries. I am not sure that ravi bhai will give funding for that.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> Eklavya family will be there, lots of new people, friends, projects</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> instability of funding. We need to leave our work which we started in vadodra. We might not get access to children like school. Because we will work with libraries.</p>
<p>I am eliminating BLR right now but we have shortlisted some org if we want to go : creative school, beme, project DEFY, seed to sapling, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me &amp; Nidhi both went to Nephropathy this year at Nisargupchar Kendra - Gotri, Vadodra. It is wonderful place.
I am suffering from stomach problems and Nidhi is suffering from skin - hair issues. (apart from our mental health) We tried following the diet for month or two.. it was magical.. it works. eating millets and doing yoga. After one point of time it got difficult for us to manage the routine and making food at home. but we want to start it again when we get new place to stay and work. This year I want to start doing regular exercise &amp; eating healthy food. (This very basic and obvious thing but very hard to do )</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golu">Golu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s brother Tanishk aka golu was also there with us in Vadodra for few months. Nidhi invited him to take break after his 12th exam and explore options other than joining privet engineering collage. It was mistake&hellip; we were not ready. it was difficult to make some one self directed learner in short time. Also against his will. It was good learning for us to see what is happening inside us when situation like this come on our face. what happens inside us? , can we empathize ? it was tough time for me personally.</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t find meaning in this type of exploration time, he became phone - game addict, he bought new iphone and it was game changer for him&hellip; in short some mistake from our side, some expectation from his side.. it didn&rsquo;t work out. I was so happy when he went back home. I was genuinely concerned and still I am concerned about his future. I never thought bad about him but our expectation didn&rsquo;t match. We were super busy in our work we really didn&rsquo;t give proper time to him&hellip; it was wrong timing.</p>

<h3 id="reflections--proudest-moments-of-the-year-things-you-dont-like-about-this-year-something-you-learnt-about-yourself">Reflections : Proudest moments of the year, Things you don&rsquo;t like about this year, something you learnt about yourself</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our work got recognized : <a href="https://www.early-bird.in/meet-an-educator-mihir-pathak/">ebird - meet the educator article</a> - feeling proud.</li>
<li>I could manage to do local khoji event even with the stress and work load of pratham. I could have done better if I have time. I really didn&rsquo;t get time for the facilitating the project.</li>
<li>We (Nidhi, Mihir, Impana) managed to do &lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo; exhibition. I was on cloud 7 :)</li>
<li>This year I wrote regular <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a> on my website from week 12 to week 52 = 40 weeks = 10 months. I never thought that I will continue this habit. But I did. I am proud of it.</li>
<li>In first week of Dec I visited BLR to attend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDd2w5movCJ/?img_index=1">wipro partners</a> (my reflections) forum and meeting children at BeMe. Meeting children from 12+ group was a joy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2024/beme.jpeg" alt="BeMe Children "></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This year was very stressful and I felt serious anxiety many a times. Because of nature of work at Pratha,Home / family issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I first time tried fund raising. I pitched our work and managed to raised 9L rupees for a year from individual donors. I am very very grateful to them for trusting us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did session with corporate team for first time. Thank you Mitali ben for co- facilitating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I contributed / spent big amount of grant money and pratham&rsquo;s salary money for marriage prep, which I didn&rsquo;t like. I wanted to use that money for children or save it for future. Any way I am happy that we did camp from that money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year also I am part of Child Development and learning course at Eklavya. I co facilitated sessions this time. After the physical workshop we as team to need to be more active to respond the participant&rsquo;s need. But I felt that other team members are busy with other work and not able to give priority to this. It is frustrating for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year we (Nidhi and Mihir) took many workshops and sessions with different age groups. In 2025 we want to take up one project and do deeper work in that. We will take up the project of developing curriculum for Nature Detective program (age 3 to 11yrs) and for older age group we will work with children from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We will also plan to do action research kind of thing with Nature Classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took logistic responsibility for the residential camps we did this year. I invited Nidhi, Nishtha and Prerna for facilitation. It was a good experience for me. I learnt about my self that I enjoy doing this type of work also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sangha - tribe - community got stronger in mind this year. I learnt that if you want to walk on this path of alternatives you need strong sangha.. and you need to selflessly contribute in that sangha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year tested my and nidhi&rsquo;s bonding.. hard time.. stress.. things we hated came back to us&hellip;but we are strong &amp; together. Thank you so much Nidhi for being you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these years I was very confused about my offering in education. I am not a subject teacher, I am not a teacher trainer, I don&rsquo;t want to start NGO to scale things.. what exactly I want to do ? This year I got some answers :</p>

<h3 id="what-next-">What next ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work front : till 15th March 2025 - Project DEFY&rsquo;s work is there.</li>
<li>Need to figure out work after that. Gopaldham and Balgokulam people will reply in mid Jan. After that we will take a call. I am mostly inclined towards going to mitali ben&rsquo;s school for 1 year and then going back to BLR / stay back if we get regular funding. If we go to mitali ben&rsquo;s school, we will take up curriculum development project for nature detective and also collaborate with nature classroom for action research &amp; material development.</li>
<li>I want to continue work in vadodara. Specially with sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We (Rameshwari ben , Ashish bhai, Saurabh bhai, Nikita ben, Suraj, Mihir &amp; Nidhi) started one fellowship program for teenager. It&rsquo;s kind of swaraj university model / beme model / self directed learning / relationship model. It was a longest wish to do this type of work with youth. I am looking forward to that.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>I am prying to universe to give me strength to manage my wedding event peacefully</p>
<p>After writing this much I still feel I missed something..but it&rsquo;s ok. I will update here if I remember something.
let&rsquo;s hope for the best. At this moment I just want to say thank you to Nidhi for always being with me in every situation. Thank you so much to all my friends and extended family.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="30th-to-7th-dec-2024-saturday-to-saturday-">30th to 7th Dec 2024 (Saturday to Saturday )</h4>
<p>1st Dec : we (Mihir, Nidhi and Mitali ben) met jagdish bhai (donor of kanisa school)
2nd Dec : spent time with Nidhi at her place. We went for a brunch at Cafe Bangalore. We mostly talked about the Job and future of our work.</p>
<p>at this point we have few opportunities :</p>
<p>We have eliminated these :</p>
<ul>
<li>creative school and other alternative schools in BLR</li>
<li>Moving to Cooore / Joining youcan</li>
</ul>
<p>Current options :</p>
<ul>
<li>Project DEFY and BeMe (Bangalore)</li>
<li>Balgokulam</li>
<li>Vapi home schooling group</li>
<li>getting funds and work at Mitali ben&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>going to bhopal, find out some work at Eklavya</li>
<li>Shishukunj, Bhuj</li>
<li>varun khimani jashdan - gopaldham learning center</li>
</ul>
<p>right now we both are feeling that Bangalore option is great financially and growth wise
but my family (specifically father) wants that we stay in Vadodra and do work here. We are feeling helpless.
we want to be near to our parents but other side there is a financial struggle, we will not get money in Vadodara.
we can definitely do good work if we get funding. let&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>4th to 7th dec - APU - Wipro Partners Forum 2024</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>saturday evening Mitali ben came home and had a talk with Me and Nidhi sapratly
after that we went to padra, had a talk with my parents. Main three things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>golu should not live here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi should come padra often (once a week) and help mummy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to save money / they needed some financial clearity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>meeting went well.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sunday morning me and Nidhi came to padra, satyed till evening. Evening we (Mihir, Nidhi, Golu) went to SAF (sai&rsquo;s angel foundation)
one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; I have praposed two ideas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture</li>
<li>tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do</li>
</ol>
<p>most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children&rsquo;s enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.</p>
<p>I shifited back to padra.</p>
<p><strong>Monday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work. In evening I met <a href="https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/nihar-pandya">Nihar Pandya</a> at Gulmahor</li>
<li>My blood presure got down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to hospital</li>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to nidhi&rsquo;d place and worked form there.</li>
<li>it was difficult day for me. First of telling at home that I want to go at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. I was anxious. At nidhi&rsquo;s place it was difficult for me to listen golu&rsquo;s voice. I don&rsquo;t like the rude tone and other thing is whole routine stuff.. I can&rsquo;t see him like this. I shouldn&rsquo;t give this option of gap year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what else ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I randomly did msg to Yogen shah, wrong decision. His is just like I met him for so 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratham work is going good. Now I am confident about writing script, making poster and editing / making video in canva.
For canva part I still take help of Archi and Neha. They are pro. I need to play more with canva to make it normal for me. Just like I tinker with my website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sunday khoji club will not happen. I need to go for prayer of one relative. But children are very very excited. They ready with their tasks.
I see big hope to this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early bird approached for facilitating birdwalk in Vadodara. I am not sure we will able to do it or not. I will take final call today and email them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am learning to balance my time between work, Nidhi&rsquo;s place and parents place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Thursday I saw documentary on swami brahmvedantaji again. This is like 5th or 6th time. This I understood what is &lsquo;self - remembering&rsquo; and what is the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો હોંશ થી કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં તમારી હાજરી રહે એવી રીતે કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં પણ રહેવાનું છે અને સાથે સાથે આપણું મૂળ સ્વરૂપ પણ યાદ રાખવાનું છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there is real self without any filters. our ego is making this suffering more difficult.
we need to remember our true self each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too much gyan. It is simple practice.</p>

This time I stayed home.

<ul>
<li>
<p>last saturday was working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday nidhi went to take a session at vinoba ashram with amit bhai. This time I stayed home. Took some rest.
If I go to a workshop it takes half of my Sunday and it&rsquo;s difficult to get a break on weekdays because of work.
It was difficult for me to decide because Nidhi needs support in session. But we had a chat and she agreed to go alone.
My evening session at sai&rsquo;s angel foundation got canceled because their office got flooded during heavy rains last to last week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday, Tuesday - hectic days at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday we went to Nisarag Upchar Kendra (Vinoba Ashram) to take naturopathy treatment for me and nidhi. It was a long due.
We got a new routine and diet. We need to eat Millets, fruits, soups :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday, Friday - again busy days at work. Following a new routine is fun + a little difficult. Especially since there are three people at home.
all three need to eat different things. Golu don&rsquo;t like millets and things we eat without masala. So we need to cook for everyone differently.
Nidhi and my diet has some common elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi is trying to manage new routine and her work (taking sessions with children and planning for the sessions). Right now most of her time is going in to cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the rains washing machine got damaged. Repair guy came yesterday and fixed it. It was a panel issue. I didn&rsquo;t give much attention..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the parents front : Mitali ben had a talk with my parents and now we need to go to meet them on sunday. I am super anxious about what I will talk about&hellip;
According to mitali ben they are ready for marriage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They just want</p>
<ul>
<li>ki me Nidhi ko financial support na karu apne pese bacha ke rakhu :) basically financial security</li>
<li>Nidhi jab bhi mere familiy valo se mile thoda friendly tarike se mile</li>
<li>they are ok ki hum bahar rahe..</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This Sunday I have my &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; session planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else ?</p>
<p>I am super frustrated with golu’s behavior. Talking in loud voice
Talking rudely with nidhi, seeing everything from lens of money.
Where I will get more money
Which thing is more costly, I want to grab that because it is costly = good / status
Not getting uncomfortable in anything</p>
<p>He is not following routine at all, all day watching reels or tarak mehta.. All day putting earphones in ears. Waking up like 10 - 11 everyday…</p>
<p>Actually I am ok with routine because, eventually he will get bored and find some activity to learn.
We gave some options like gym, swimming, coaching class for CUET exam, Ankur warikoo’s online course about communication, self learning math and other subjects</p>
<p>He is doing that online course sometimes, and sometimes he does self learning for math. other options are on hold because of rain and willingness
But it is like 2 hrs a day.. All the other time goes on mobile..</p>
<p>I am doubtful that mobile phones will not give the opportunity to get bored.
Let’s see…</p>
<p>Now I am feeling that we should have not called him here and let him do the college he was planning to do. Now it is too late</p>
<p>Few days ago my anger bursted and said something to golu which he didn’t like.
Today I will try to write a sorry email to him.</p>

It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="17th-to-24th-august-2024">17th to 24th August 2024</h4>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂</p>
<p>Also I wanted to support Nidhi. It went well. It was not a very well planned session but it was the first session and everything was new for Nidhi so she did planning according to her understanding. I gave very less time to planning. Next time we will do more tight planning.</p>
<p>I can see Nidhi growing as a facilitator. She is opening up slowly. She needs to learn how to judge the group and decide the activities.</p>
<p>Working with Amit bhai is a little bit difficult because of his expectations and ideas about the activities. But his intention is good so we will figure it out. We will figure out a way to work together.</p>
<p>Now the next workshop is on 2nd september so we need to work on the same. Topic is - ecosystem and interconnectedness</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Monday we were at home only, did home set up the kitchen and other stuff.</p>
<p>Tuesday we went to the office, Nidhi had a meeting with Amit bhai. Reflected on the session.</p>
<p>I did my pratham’s work. Evening we went to a restaurant. Amit bhai shared that Gulmahor will be not available for september so we have decided to work from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Wed, Thu, Fri and Sat - not been to the office. Worked from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Work wise it was a good productive week. I completed most of my tasks.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Whole week I woke around 7.30 to 7.40 (except today. Today I woke up at 8.13) and did stretching, reading for some time. Nidhi also woke up around 8 whole week. She also did stretching. I felt so happy that she did it without being negative. Today we did suryanamaskar together. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi made breakfast - lunch and dinner everyday. It was very good for my stomach and eating together was fun.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; We got Jio wifi on thursday. Now I can attend office calls without any limits and yes we can watch tv without any worry about data limit. It is useful and tempting both. We saw lage raho munna bhai and all india rank together (Golu, Nidhi, Mihir)</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Working with golu is tough for me. Waking up late, being sleepy and not active in the morning, watching TV or mobile all the time, connecting everything with money - fame - success, not focusing on tasks, being negative in doing physical activity. Eating chilen, not sleeping without AC. I took all the things on my ego. I got stressed about how we will go forward with this mindset.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a good discussion about the future plan. How to do projects and prepare for the exam. We saw all the courses on the internet but he is not sure what to do. So we decided to do projects and prepare for the common university entrance exam.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how everything goes. I am hopeful. I also want to learn how to work with teenagers of this background.</p>
<p>I saw that entrepreneurship is a common subject we like so we will do something about it. Today I gave him a challenge to sit without doing anything for two hours. Let&rsquo;s see he can do it. I will give 1k if I can. I know I should not introduce money in this but I can&rsquo;t help but think that other options are closed right now.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; What else ? Other things are ok. Whenever I think about situations at home, I feel stressed so I am engaging myself in other tasks. Not thinking about it. I am looking forward to the session at sai’s angle - saturday club. Yesterday Neha from Moinee foundation called me for curriculum development work, I am looking forward to that also.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="3rd-to-10th-august-2024">3rd to 10th August 2024</h4>
<ul>
<li>Came to gulmahor evryday with Nidhi</li>
<li>We (Mihir &amp; Nidhi) met harshal from wipro eartian on 7th august. It was wonderful meeting. We got to know that he runs interesting children magazine called &lsquo;Kulfi&rsquo; in marathi.</li>
<li>Nidhi worked on session planning</li>
<li>House huntting</li>
</ul>
<p>Sent this email to namrata di and vishal bhai :</p>
<p>આપણે વાત કરવા માટેનો સમય સેટ નથી થઇ રહ્યો એટલે મેં વિચાર્યું કે ઈમેલ જ કરું, શાંતિ થી પોતાના સમયે વાંચી શકાય</p>
<p><strong>અત્યારે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>મારુ પ્રથમ માં કામ ધીમે ધીમે ચાલી રહ્યું છે. મારે વેસ્ટ મેન્જમેન્ટ, કલામેન્ટ ચેન્જ વિષય પર વિવિધ વિડીયો માટેની સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાની હોય છે. મારો તો સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાનો પહેલો અનુભવ છે એટલે મને થોડી વાર લાગે, બ્રેઈન સ્ટોર્મ કરવા જોઈએ, ક્રિએટિવ કામ છે પણ અહીં આ લોકો એકદમ ફેક્ટરી અપ્રોચ વાપરે છે એટલે મને ખુબ સ્ટ્રેસ થાય.  ટિમ આખી રીમોટ્લી કામ કરે છે, એના ફાયદા છે પણ ગેરફાયદા પણ છે. કોઈ કલ્ચર અથવા કામ સિવાય વાત નહિ.
એક વખત રેઝિગ્નેશન આપવાની કોશિશ કરી પણ ટીમ લિડે કીધું કે તારું કામ બદલી નાખીએ એટલે તને થોડી મજા આવે :) આમ કરી કરી ને ચાલે છે. કેટલીક વાર બધું અર્થ વગરનું લાગે, કોઈક વાર નવું શીખવા મળે છે, મન ઉપર કામ થઇ રહ્યું છે..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ અહીં પાછી આવી ગઈ છે. એની ફેલોશીપ નું કામ શરૂ કરશે, અમિત ભાઈ અને બીજા એક બે મિત્રો બાળકો શોધવા માં મદદ કરી રહ્યા છે. અત્યારે 3 લર્નિંગ સેન્ટર ઉપર બાળકો સાથે નેચર એજ્યુકેશન પર કામ થશે એવું ગોઠવ્યું છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>હું અહીં રામેશ્વરી બેન ની સંસ્થાના બાળકો સાથે થોડો સમય વિતાવું છું. લોકલ ખોજી કરીને &lsquo;લોકલ સિવિક પ્રોબ્લેમ સોલવિંગઃ&rsquo; ઉપર એક કોર્સ લીધો. આ ગ્રુપ આપણા 12+ ના ગ્રુપ જેવું જ છે. એમની સાથે નાના નાના પ્રોજેક્ટ કરું છું.
એ લોકો માટે ઇન્ટર્નશિપ ડિઝાઇન કરી રહ્યા છે. હું વિચારતો હતો કે બીમી ના બાળકો પણ અહીં ઇન્ટર્નશિપ કરવા માટે આવી શકે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઈમ્પના અને સાત્વિકા સાથે અઠવાડિયા માં એક વખત વાત થઇ જાય છે. પોડકાસ્ટ વાળા પ્રોજેક્ટ પાછો શરૂ કરવાનો છે. કોશિશ કરી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ઘરે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ઘણી વાર મને લાગે કે અમે વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય ખોટો લઇ લીધો. એ વખતે નિધિ ને થિન્ક ટેક માં ન ફાવ્યું, એ બીમી માં સેટ થશે કે નહિ એ મને ડાઉટ હતો, ઘરે મમ્મી ને અને પપ્પા ની તબિયત સારી નહોતી રહેતી, સગાઈ માટે પણ અમે લોકો અહીં એમની સામે હતા તે સારું રહ્યું , જો અહીં રહેવા ન આવ્યા હોત તો સગાઈ માટે અઘરું પડત. આ બધું જોતા વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય બરાબર લાગે છે. પણ બીમી ને ખુબ મિસ કરું છું હું. મને ઘણા વર્ષો પછી મારે જેવું કામ કરવું હતું એના માટેનું પ્લેટફોર્મ મળ્યું હતું, પણ હું ચાહતો હોવા છતાં કામ ન કરી શક્યો.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ હમણાં લગ્ન ન થાય ત્યાં સુધી અલગ ઘર માં રહેવાની છે. એના ઘરે થી સાથે રહેવાની પરમિશન નથી, મારા ઘરે એવો કઈ વાંધો નથી પણ&hellip; + એનો નાના ભાઈએ 12 પછી એક વર્ષનો બ્રેક લીધો છે, એટલે એ પણ રહેવા આવવા માંગે છે એટલે એવું સેટ કર્યું છે હમણાં. ઘર શોધી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઘરે એક દિવસ મેં નિધિ સાથે વાસણ ઘસ્યા એમાં મમ્મી - પપ્પા ને બહુ ખરાબ લાગ્યું. એમને એવું થયું કે નિધિ મારી પાસે કામ કરાવે છે. મેં કીધું કે અમે બંને મળીને કામ કરી રહ્યા છે. પણ એ ન માન્યા, નિધિ કઈ મને ફોર્સ કરીને નહોતી બોલાવતી. બીજી રીતે પણ એ લોકો એવી એક્સપેક્ટેશન રાખે કે નિધિ જોબ ના કરે બસ ઘરનું કામ કરે.. પપ્પા ને તો  હજી આ સંબંધ ગમતો જ નથી, પૈસાની બાબતે પણ એમને એવું થાય.. નિધિ ની જોબ નહોતી ત્યારે મેં નિધિ ને મેં થોડી મદદ કરી હતી એમાં એમને વાંધો પડી ગયો.. કેમ એને પૈસા આપ્યા.. આ છોકરી બધા પૈસા પડાવી લેશે ને આવું બધું.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>મને બહુ જ ગુસ્સો આવે, પણ કોને કહું કેવી રીતે આમાં આગળ વધુ ખબર નથી પડતી, મને લાગતું હતું મમ્મી સમજશે, એ પણ આવી જ બધી વાતો કરે છે. તો હમણાં આ બધી વાતનો સ્ટ્રેસ ચાલે છે.</p>
<p>ચાલો હમણાં આટલી અપડેટ રાખીએ, પછી પાછા વધારે વાત કરીશું</p>
<p>આવજો</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a podcast from Scaler called ScalerPod. Where they interview CTOs from different startups. They ask about their journey, challenges and how their typical day looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Till now I have seen two episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)&#xA;Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to a podcast from Scaler called ScalerPod. Where they interview CTOs from different startups. They ask about their journey, challenges and how their typical day looks like.</p>
<p>Till now I have seen two episodes.</p>
<p>Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)
Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)</p>
<p>I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.</p>
<p>He shared that intrinsic motivation for work comes from three things :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autonomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mastry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connectedness / Purpose</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here you go :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEZMSbeziEw&amp;t=870s">14:30</a> What motivates engineers?</p>
<p><strong>Full episode :</strong></p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEZMSbeziEw?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>I resonate with this idea so much so sharing here as a self note :)</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain? People who have empty cars are offering seats to others. If we create such an app, car owners will know who else needs a ride.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain? People who have empty cars are offering seats to others. If we create such an app, car owners will know who else needs a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but these types of apps are already there, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m talking about a local app.
Another great idea was an app for men&rsquo;s customized clothes. But madam wouldn’t even listen to it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also suggested a game idea, and she did the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s stop judging these students&rsquo; ideas and talk about their college teacher instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of listening to the students&rsquo; ideas and giving constructive feedback, she directly rejects them, saying it’s not possible.</li>
<li>She insults students in class in front of everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior crushes the self-esteem and confidence of the students. We need teachers who allow young people to share new ideas freely. When they receive support without fear, their creativity can flourish. Remember these young people are entrepreneur of tomorrow</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening one of our local khojis called me.&#xA;She is studying in 10th grade and part of a local khoji program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She called me to share that she is going to do ‘nature bingo’ and ‘web of life’ activity with her class as part of geography class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her teacher gave a task to explain some topics from the textbook in a hands-on manner.&#xA;This girl took the opportunity to introduce the wonder of nature to her classmates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday evening one of our local khojis called me.
She is studying in 10th grade and part of a local khoji program.</p>
<p>She called me to share that she is going to do ‘nature bingo’ and ‘web of life’ activity with her class as part of geography class.</p>
<p>Her teacher gave a task to explain some topics from the textbook in a hands-on manner.
This girl took the opportunity to introduce the wonder of nature to her classmates.</p>
<p>She made my day by sharing this.</p>
<p>This is the butterfly effect for me</p>
<p>If you provide a locally relevant direct experiences + provide safe space to flourish
Young people can do wonders.</p>
<p>Local khoji and many many other organization and initiatives working with youth, environment, citizenship - are BIG hope for me.</p>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What helped me?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What enables people to live a self - directed life ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<li>How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?</li>
<li>What helped me?</li>
<li>What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?</li>
<li>What enables people to live a self - directed life ?</li>
</ul>
<p>if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people</p>
<p>to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness</p>
<p>think about the 16 year old boy or girl from small city like Vadodara, middle class family</p>
<ul>
<li>got typical education from school</li>
<li>no idea what career options / study options are available apart from typical sci, commerce and arts streams</li>
<li>no self confidence, very little self worth, no particular interests or ambition</li>
<li>easily get influenced by advertisements and media. No critical thinking lens</li>
</ul>
<p>In my journey what are the differentiators ?</p>
<p>the foundation is same but,</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to work on real life projects
I met people + spaces who don&rsquo;t judge, believe in you and give you the platform. Which ultimately become my tribe / community</p>
<p>How can I create this for friends and peers in Vadodara and my hometown Padra ?</p>
<p>Can project based learning become a starting point ?</p>
<p>Do one research / making / solving/entrepreneurship project around your city. Your questions, your ideas.</p>
<p>I will connect you with subject matter expert, will fund your project, will connect you with further opportunity  (internship / course / job / funding / learning)</p>
<p>This gives you non judgemental space, self confidence, you work in team, express yourself creatively and much more.</p>
<p>after the project done you becomes part of khoji community and keep doing interesting stuff</p>
<p>we will try to guide you for career opportunity, other learning opportunities</p>
<p>Local khoji is a distillation of ideas which I have been dreaming of for years.
Give unconventional, transformative learning experience to children.</p>
<p>This is not a CSR project / Not a NGO, it is just an initiative. I am very much open for collaboration
I am ready to share all my learnings / ideas / support  if you want to start local khoji at your town, your org, your school, your community. It can fit in your existing programs, curriculum and timetables.</p>

At that point of time I was not feeling confident and comfortable about putting this in my notes but now I am feeling that I should put it so I can document the important incident of my life.

Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I am technically not skilled enough to develop content using AI tools. Young people in my team use AI like a pro. I sometimes run out of learning new skills and hold on to what I already know.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I mostly worked in small teams. Worked directly with the founder or team leads. where people know my skills and they value it. Give recongtion. Here I am one of hundrads. so I am feeling unreconigiesd.&#xA;not feeling part of the larger thing, not feeling belogingness. I don&amp;rsquo;t know this is good or bad but it is happening that much I know&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;also I feel that : do I really invest my energy in content development work or directly work with children but with clear vision and goals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In this week I took local khoji&amp;rsquo;s online session&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On friday my nanaji got expierd because of long time illness.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been 11 years now working in the education sector. I worked with children age 3yrs to 18yrs. Schools from state board to IB boards. Homeschooling groups and alternative schools too..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for the last few years I got interested in working with teenagers or youth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How to give a platform to youth to thrive ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How to give opportunities where they can build their agency&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how they can be self directed learner and foster life skills&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how they engage in local environment and civic problems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are some of my goals when I say working with youth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been 11 years now working in the education sector. I worked with children age 3yrs to 18yrs. Schools from state board to IB boards. Homeschooling groups and alternative schools too..</p>
<p>for the last few years I got interested in working with teenagers or youth.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to give a platform to youth to thrive ?</li>
<li>How to give opportunities where they can build their agency</li>
<li>how they can be self directed learner and foster life skills</li>
<li>how they engage in local environment and civic problems</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of my goals when I say working with youth.</p>
<p>As a self -directed learner I saw that you need two very strong pillars to build your journey.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>non judgmental safe space + mentor/friend/peers who can challenge you, give reflective tools to you. Basically your tribe, who trust you, believe in you no matter how good you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure, Projects, Challenges, Things which helps you to shift your orbit
These are the two main things which I believe are game changers. I saw multiple organizations working on the same design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to spend the next 10 years of my life on this problem. What will be my intervention design ?</p>
<ul>
<li>can we design a program where children can do real life project</li>
<li>where children can opportunity to think, work in team, find mentors and more</li>
</ul>
<p>What should be the context ? Theme ?</p>
<p>Can we give the local environment and civic as a theme ?
If you merge it all together :</p>
<p>Local khoji - a platform for children to conduct original and authentic inquiry projects about the cities they live in.</p>
<p>Children can different type of projects - research projects, making projects, story project rooted in place they live.</p>
<p>This will be a 3 to 4 month journey, according to how much time school / NGO / learning centers give to work on the project.</p>
<p>This program design is very much inspired by Solve Ninja (Reap Benefit) and City as lab - Mumbai (@cityaslabindia)</p>
<p>What happened after this intervention ? children who were involved in can start a club called ‘Khoji club’ which will become a incubator / Adda kind of place for children. There will be different events happening, reading - making - movie screening - talks and lots of fun.</p>
<p>I want to make the whole process open source so anybody can run local khoji and khoji clubs at their own place. And I want to focus on more innovative ideas. I don’t want to run as a typical NGO / org but more like a laboratory where I constantly work on ideas to re imagine learning.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/&#34;&gt;ASER ‘Byond Basics’&lt;/a&gt; report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do they have technology access / smart phone &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are their aspirations &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can they read and do basic maths &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I read the <a href="https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/">ASER ‘Byond Basics’</a> report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do they have technology access / smart phone </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are their aspirations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can they read and do basic maths </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smartphones are a great equlazirer but contentwise we are competing with youtube. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of content we should publish in this situation </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we ask youth what they want?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are you looking at learning happening outside the school ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These all are questions to the window of possibilities. I read the report and some other articles. I am writing some insights which I got reflecting on them. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to have dialgue with youth about what they want </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only creating content and putting it in the air will not work, we need to make the whole ecosystem of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can blame or expect schools to teach everything we need to look at the needs of this age group outside the school structure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to create informal learning spaces where young people can come, talk, and explore freely. (The youth wants a space to share their feelings, anxieties, and fears about the future.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second step can be nudging them for some learning - challenging activities where smartphones or technology can play a bigger role. But that one on one connect, guidance, mentorship is important </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take one scenario : </p>
<p>You started one youth program where young people join and teach children. Through this program you started one ‘youth adda’ where young people can come freely to talk - hangout. </p>
<p>Slowly you made genuine friendship with them, now they are open for your ideas and guidance.</p>
<p>You suggested they do one short course on ‘financial literacy’ so they can manage their finances well. Now high quilty content is important.</p>
<p>Youtube is winning because it is no brainer. You don’t need to think to see insta reels or youtube shots. You need brain, motivation and many other factors to see ‘learning content’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One way is, make your learning content in format of shots and influncere kind of videos. Like Vlogs and more. There are chances that you need to dilute your content to add those types of mirch masala.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second way is to build an ecosystem which encourages and nudges us to explore ‘learning content’ apart from those nobrainers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about Ankur wariku. He is making videos on financial literacy. Apart from making videos he is doing insta live with people to help them to learn ‘how to invest in their given salary’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He is building a community. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is taking subjects which very very relevant to young people </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we need to do both things in balance. We need to make our content more engaging and on the other side we need to build an ecosystem around it. </p>
<p>There are some more insights about vocational training and basic reading and maths </p>
<p>Which I will write some other time. </p>
<p><strong>Two very interesting panel discussions :</strong> </p>

<p>Whole week went in an engagement thing. It was a complex project beyond my expectation. event management + people&rsquo;s ego management and what not..But I somehow finished it. I want to put photographs here but cropping and uploading is a little difficult when you are updating a website / blog from a local machine. I will put it on instagram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pitched nature education to one CSR through rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO but didn&rsquo;t get a positive response. The person was more inclined towards STEM and career oriented intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesterday I met Amit Arora. He runs an NGO called Paper Ball Education. We have discussed how we can collaborate on the nature education front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to see Swara&rsquo;s house. It is a beautiful house. Let&rsquo;s see if everything works out. We will rent out that space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 15th Pratham work will start. So I am looking forward for that</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<p>This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.</p>
<p>Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &lsquo;Anubhti&rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.  </p>
<p>And alternative schools are only in the cities.</p>
<p>On the other side I got a call from my mother that my father&rsquo;s health is not good and it would be great if I will be there with family.</p>
<p><strong>What to do ?</strong> If someone passionately wants to work with children on a deeper level, alternative schools are the only platform I can see right now and they are not giving much salary. Waldorf schools, krishnamurti schools, democratic schools.. Another option is going to so-called progressive schools or international schools.</p>
<p>Most of the people working in alternative schools already worked in corporate for many years then they started school or started working in the schools. For them it is not their primary income source. For an educator full time doing this work with children for 10 years, there is no financial support system for them. There is no support system of like minded people whcih which most important thing for your growth and mental health.</p>
<p>Either they need to take side projects like consultancy or join the NGO / Development sector as manager roles. Even in NGOs ground workers who actually go and implement the program don&rsquo;t get much salary.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to tackle this thing is</strong>, if you have a partner who can support you. I saw in alternative schools one partner works in corporate and the other works in school.</p>
<p><strong>What about starting your own NGO or company ?</strong> The NGO world is highly dependent on CSR money or grants.</p>
<p>There are too many competitors and there are big players capturing the market. The game is who can do fund raising well. Who can show their work better. Who can scale things. Still there is hope because there are many companies, there is always the possibility to get small small projects every year. But this is a struggle every year.. if you see the larger picture, a 50 years old NGO also struggles to get funding. Instead of working with children, most of your energy goes to find funding</p>
<p><strong>Starting an educational company is the worst idea ever</strong>, a super cluttered market, very difficult to find product market fit. I have never come across company with really good product making money without taking money from CSR</p>
<p><strong>Ok let&rsquo;s come back to the point.</strong> So after a long discussion with Nidhi we have decided that we will not go to Pune.  We asked friends at  Eklavya Foundation if there is any work opportunity. But they are struggling with funding and extension problems so it will take 3 -4 months to materialize anything.</p>
<p><strong>Second option is :</strong> We will go to Vadodara so we can be with family. Now what about work ?</p>
<p>I said no anubhuti people. They are kind and sensitive enough so they understood my situation and supported me.</p>
<p>There is no established alternative school in Vadodara. There are one or two but they are very school and in their early stage. so the same problem. They will get parent volunteers so they will not need full time faculties.</p>
<p><strong>We thought let&rsquo;s start &lsquo;Nature Education&rsquo; work with children.</strong> Exprinatial - Project Based learning : That&rsquo;s what we know. We thought let&rsquo;s start working. For funding we will reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>We reached out to Akansha, Ravi bhai and Rameshwari ben for funding and many other friends to include them in our initiative as &rsquo;learning partner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also applied for a full time job at Pratham as Production Manager of Digital Content. It will be a remote job from Vadodara and once in a month I need to go to Pune. The idea behind it is, if I get it Nidhi will do full time work of Nature Education and we can have one income source in our bag if we don&rsquo;t get funding in future.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> we are waiting for replies from people whom we asked for individual grants.
Also waiting from pratham people to reply about the Job.</p>
<p><strong>The good part is</strong> when I reached out to friends at Vadodara saying I am moving back to vadodara. They were super happy and welcoming. I am really looking forward to the whole thing. It is risky, we don&rsquo;t have any backup, no savings, we need to support our families, at least I don&rsquo;t have any academic qualification and all to go back.. we are at in the ocean.. let&rsquo;s see what will unfold</p>
<h4 id="one-more-good-update-is---vadodra-city-walks">One more good update is - Vadodra City Walks</h4>
<p>we have launched something called &lsquo;Vadodara City Walks&rsquo; with children from Rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO.
20 teenage children are exploring water - river in their own city. We had our first orientation on 12th April. We will have our first session with them on 20th April 2024. I am very very excited for this. I had a talk with Siddharth (Veditum) for the same. He is very happy to help and guide me on this journey. I am super happy and greatful. Thank you so much to Jubin for connecting us.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say about this week. During this whole week Nidhi was not around. She is in Pune to find a job herself and a house for both of us. I was feeling low, anxious, tense the whole week..&#xA;we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>My sleep cycle is gone, I am sleeping at 2 - 2.30 at night and waking up by 9 - 10 am.
I have become a mobile addict, not the reels or social media but reading / browsing other stuff.

<p><img src="/w14/terminal.jpg" alt="Terminal">
<img src="/w14/terminal.jpg" alt="Terminal"></p>
<p>I spent most of my time this week in developing small small features in my website.
I wanted to escape from the situation so I engaged myself in learning new things and implementing on my website.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have redesigned page called <a href="https://learningwala.in/educational-practice/">&lsquo;Educational Practice&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>updated &lsquo;about us&rsquo; text in all social media (medium, linkedin, instagram)</li>
<li>implemented &lsquo;hugo-bearcub&rsquo; theme with CSS tweak and RSS feed set up</li>
<li>I have shifted all weekly notes in blog section with &lsquo;weekly-notes&rsquo; tag</li>
<li>Custom domain set up with cloudflare SSL certificate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--linkedin2md">- Linkedin2MD</h4>
<ul>
<li>I made a copy of my linkedin profile in markdown. I tried using the npm package (<a href="https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md">https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md</a>) but it didn&rsquo;t work for me so I used inbuilt resume builder of linked in and downloaded PDF and converted it into markdown. I did a little bit (actually a lot time wise) manual editing and adding / copy-pasting specific data from the linkedin profile which was missing in resume builder. Now I have a complete profile on my website which I can update anytime / send it to anyone. I need to put a PDF version of the same.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--medium-posts-in-markdown">- Medium posts in markdown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Medium changed its policy for readers, that was the one of the triggers to start this website and blog. I have been using Medium for the last 11 years so I wanted to take a backup of my old posts
and put it here in this blog. I checked the medium setting and downloaded all the files but it came in html format which is no use for me directly. I need to convert it into a markdown to put it here. I found and tried one python script and one npm package. The npm package didn&rsquo;t work for me. The Python script worked but it was converting one file at a time. I have lots of files. So I am stuck.
I am searching for another tool or I will try to tweak this script to do multiple files. If anything doesn&rsquo;t work I will do it manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--i-have-learnt-about">- I have learnt about</h4>
<ul>
<li>Github Workflow</li>
<li>How to use github issue as comment box on your website</li>
<li>using Prose.io as CMS</li>
<li>Fediverse</li>
<li>self hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>I will implement these all features in later on, not in priority. you can see what I am work on website <a href="http://simp.ly/p/W6Xjkf">here</a></p>
<h4 id="--custom-domain-email">- Custom domain email</h4>
<ul>
<li>Custom domain email id setup using zoho mail. I have created <a href="mailto:mihir@learningwala.in">mihir@learningwala.in</a> , I was searching for the trick so I can only forward emails written by humans to my new id from my gmail id. I didn&rsquo;t want any subscription / promotion / updates email to come on my new id. Finally I found something called &lsquo;filters&rsquo; in gmail where you can make rules for email forwarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use gmail for / at</p>
<ul>
<li>all the places / social accounts / subscription</li>
<li>for using cloud storage G drive (mostly if my collaborator is using it otherwise i mostly use markdown and simplenote for pretty much everything and for project management I use basecamp</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted my custom domain,it is fun to see and use.  Also I wanted to shift the communication part from gmail to a new custom email id. Where only humans communicate no machine generated emails. Custom domain email on google is costly. Also they only give 30GB cloud storage and if you use a normal paid account you will get 100 gb in 1300 rs yearly.</p>
<p>so I searched for other services which give custom domain email service. Price comparison, feature comparison</p>
<p>Migadu and Fast email came multiple times in the recommendation but finally I signed up for zoho mail. They are giving free custom domain email with 5GB email space. I have tried this service before for some time with my old domain learningwala.com. So I was familiar with it. If only humans talk 5GB is space and if it exceeds the limit/ needs more features the price is 58.34rs per month.</p>
<p>Apart from gmail I was using hey.com / hey email by 37signals (makers of basecamp). It is paid service after a one month trial. But I wrote to them that I really like the service and the price point you are offering (99$ yearly) is not affordable for me. They gave me a 1 year free subscription. I really liked the product and spacilly the desktop and mobile app with clean simple UI and their workflow features. I love writing emails in those apps. But finally I have decided that I need to move on because two reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>dependence on them for the pricing. I can afford to give 8000 rupees yearly for the email service.</li>
<li>I want to try a custom domain which is more costly then normal email on hey. So finally set an auto responder on hey account saying please email me on my new email id.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="--history-of-my-email-ids-">- History of my email ids :</h4>
<p>I have started with live.com / hotmail / outlook mail</p>
<p>Past :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:a.nzel@live.com">a.nzel@live.com</a></li>

<li><a href="mailto:mihirism1995@gmail.com">mihirism1995@gmail.com</a> (I was using it till 1.5 year ago, stopped using after my google drive got full)</li>
<li><a href="mailto:learningwala@protonmail.com">learningwala@protonmail.com</a> (made for trying out, never used it)</li>

<li><a href="mailto:mihir@learningwala.in">mihir@learningwala.in</a> (still not started using it)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-wix-payment">&mdash;&gt; Wix Payment</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have done mitaliben&rsquo;s school website domain and hosting renewal. It was difficult to do payment on wix because they only accept cards. I got new card from bank in that net banking / international purchase is not active. I tried another friend&rsquo;s card but it didn&rsquo;t work.. finally my axis bank debit card worked. The friend gave the idea that you can activate international purchases from your axis bank app. I quickly downloaded the app, and it worked.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-call-with-rameshwariben-2nd-april-2024">&mdash;&gt; Call with Rameshwariben (2nd April 2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had a call with Rameshwari ben, she wants to do some activities related to nature / environment with teenage children at her NGO. I did some research and planning for it during the week. I was thinking if we can focus on the river. Visit river, interview, nature journaling, season watch, bird watching, mapping, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have reached out to <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/faculty/ankush-gupta">Ankush from HBCSE</a>, <a href="https://yourstory.com/herstory/2022/06/world-environment-day-young-conservationist-plastic-crocodiles-sneha-shahi">Sneha</a>, <a href="https://veditum.org/">Siddharth from Veditum</a>, if they can help us in water testing and other river related activities. Ankush and Sneha replied promptly, they said they can connect me with MSU environment dept and Navrachana university, Sneha will send my requirements to her friends in vadodara so they can help. I also reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhushri-mudke-7398b030/?originalSubdomain=in">Madhushree from ATREE</a>, she sent some amazon links to buy water testing kits, Ankush also sent one link for kit.</p>
<h3 id="-writing-about-tools-for-self-directed-learning">&mdash;&gt; Writing about tools for self directed learning</h3>
<p>I have started writing about tools for self-directed learning. What are the tools which can help you in doing self directed learning? I am reflecting on my journey, observation of BeMe children, Conversation with Nidhi and Nidhi Solanki</p>
<p>some of the tools I have identified :</p>
<ul>
<li>Note taking</li>
<li>how to make your portfolio (how to document, your own narrative writing, website or other medium)</li>
<li>how approach people/ communication (cold emails, networking, researching about people - org - project - anything )</li>
<li>how manage your tasks, how to work in team</li>
<li>what is the goal of internship and how to find one</li>
<li>how to prepare yourself for internship</li>
<li>list of places where children can go and work (different location, different subject)</li>
<li>list of mentors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting resource - <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">https://www.recurse.com/self-directives</a></p>
<p>I want to write how you can learn these tools so you can implement them during your sdl journey. I will publish it after I finish writing it.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.&#xA;I was in constant stress about Nidhi&amp;rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.
I was in constant stress about Nidhi&rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..</p>
<p>On the other side communication - coordination with parents about engagement planning is going on. They are not happy that we are moving to pune without any financial security.</p>
<p>Yesterday Nidhi went to Pune for interviews and visited a few alternative schools. I am praying, hoping something will work out. Over friend Nirmala is getting enage on 12th so we are planning if we can attend the function while coming back from Pune.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="developing-my-personal-website">Developing my personal website</h3>
<p>This week I spend lots of time in making - remaking - fixing and adding content to my personal website using hugo server and github pages. I learnt that text editer is importnat part of coding process. first I used sublime text and because of that hugo server was giving some error. I shifted to ubuntu defult text editor and somehow I managed to work. From last few days ubuntu was giving some glitchs on my laptop. specificly about sound and bluetooth. Sound was not coming and bluetooth was not connecting to my boat blootooth speaker. I tried different driver and fixing stuff using ubuntu forums and other websites but no sucess. Finally I re installed ubuntu. Before that I tried using and lots of reading about Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora.. I installed Pop OS but not satisfied with it, tried Manjaro but I didn&rsquo;t like KDE. Finally I came back to ubuntu 22. During this process of making website I reserched a lot about :</p>
<ul>
<li>static site genrator like hugo, pelican and more</li>
<li>Minimal - indie web blogging platform</li>
<li>Personal wiki and note taking tool</li>
<li>linux distro like manjaro, arch linux</li>
<li>How to use dynamic page and CMS in wix.com</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhxznWkXYAAsJch?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="linux distro"></p>
<p>I know these all are rabbit holes, i spent qite a lot of time to read hackernews this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t spend much time on instagram or other social media.</li>
<li>I am happy that I learnt to make website using hugo and github pages.  I wanted to use hugo-bearcub theme but it is giving some error. Currently I am using hugo-bearblog theme</li>
<li>making your personal wiki using <a href="http://simplenote.com/">&lsquo;simple note&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>I refreshed my knowldge about git , markdown and basic terminal code</li>
<li>last week I have read few pages from book called <a href="https://public.resource.org/swaraj/">&lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg" alt="Aaron "></p>
<p>that lead me to watching <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s</a>  documetry called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo;s own boy&rsquo;. Yes I know I discovered it very late but I was amazed by watching it. it is very very thought provoking. After watching documentry I spent quite a lot of time reading about open data work of <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">thejesh GN</a> and other people. <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta</a> is also doing wonderful work of putting educational / children litreture in public domain through his website and using internet archive.  I was feeling so happy when I got to know that Aaron contributed in making of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">&lsquo;Markdown&rsquo;</a> and I am using it right now :)</p>
<h4 id="call-with-srishti--suchakra-23rd-march-2024">Call with Srishti &amp; Suchakra (23rd March 2024)</h4>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never bought new laptop in my life. I had P4 computer at home around 2008 - 9&#xA;After that when I dropped out of school and started working in different organisation, people helped me with their old laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first laptop was &lt;strong&gt;Asuse eee pc&lt;/strong&gt;.

<p>I remember going to Jigish Bhai&rsquo;s office and making live USB boot for openSUSE Linux distro. That was my first introduction to open source &amp; free software world. My mama Nirmal Pathak is fedora contributor. I remember reading Kartik Bhai&rsquo;s blog about debian &amp; Wikipedia. Doing wikipedia meetup at goraj muni seva ashram.</p>
<p>samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and world of developer :)</p>
<hr>
<p>When I went to dharampur few friends donated 2 - 3 laptops for our school.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba - Vaibhav Pandya</li>
<li>Samsung - Jubin Mehta</li>
<li>Samsung (silver) - Shruti</li>
<li>ASUSE - chirag patel</li>
</ul>
<p>All the laptop were very old, their parts stopped working one by one (like screen, keyboard, battery, etc) accept Samsung (silver) one. When I went to Bhuj one visitor at our school gifted <strong>old macbook air 2013 model</strong>. It was in pretty good condition. I swapped samsung silver with that and started using it.</p>
<p>Since then I am using it as my primary machine. Writing, web browsing, teaching MIT Scratch to children, many other tinkering.. I changed the battery few months ago.</p>

<p>In 2021 Srishti gifted her old macbook air to me. I was using it with children on and off. When Nidhi needed laptop I gave it her. But unfortunately battery of that machine got swelled like balloon. It is difficult to open the body and change it.</p>
<p>Now I gave my macbook air to her and decided to buy new - refurbished laptop.</p>
<p>After some research 2 friends suggested to check out the work of Abhas Abhinav founder of Mostly harmless computers. He is FOSS enthusiast - activist - technologist - hardware hacker - geek. He runs a libretech.shop - a ethical source for libre and liberated hardware products.</p>
<p>I visited his office. It was nostalgia for me to dive in to the world of FOSS again. This time Nidhi was also there. I was happy to introduce her to this philosophy..</p>
<p><strong>Abhas bhai gifted me a book called &lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo; which is in my reading list.</strong></p>

<p><strong>he also gifted mostlly harmless USB dive with around 13 type of linux distro</strong></p>

<p>From his recommendation I met Ved who runs refurbished laptop shop in banaswadi.
After so much of comparing and testing I finally bought refurbished Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Gen (Intel i7 8th Gen, 16GB RAM, 512 HDD)</p>

<h3 id="my-criteria-was">My criteria was</h3>
<ul>
<li>repairablity</li>
<li>possiblity to upgrade (RAM, CPU)</li>
<li>portabilty (light weight)</li>
<li>feature proof</li>
<li>compatable with linux / free bios</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinkpad X1C is not true for all criteria. Number 1 yes, 2 no , 3 big yes, 4 yes, 5 yes - linux can run very nicely but the bios is not free you can&rsquo;t do core boot. You can&rsquo;t upgrade RAM. But solution I am thinking is after 5 - 6 years of usage I can again sell it to refurbished shop and upgrade the machine.</p>
<p>Tjesh GN, Aditya, Kartik bhai, Nirmal bhai and Suchakra helped a lot take the disison. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>So <strong>welcome to family - Thinkpad X1 Carbon - 2nd March 2024</strong></p>
<p>During this process I read a lot about FOSS and again visited <a href="kartikm.wordpress.com">Kartik bhai</a> &amp; <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">Thejesh&rsquo;s blog</a>. I amazed with the power of community in FOSS and really wish to see that in education sector.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started my first blog around 2012 from one cyber cafe. It was very fascinating for me at that time.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I can put something on the computer and the whole world can see. More than blogging it was about the whole website technology was fascinating for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to school I used to roam around different offices/ shops who make websites for small businesses. I visit them as customers and ask too many questions&amp;hellip; later on I did a market job with them in exchange for learning from their developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>I started my first blog around 2012 from one cyber cafe. It was very fascinating for me at that time.<br>
I can put something on the computer and the whole world can see. More than blogging it was about the whole website technology was fascinating for me.</p>
<p>Instead of going to school I used to roam around different offices/ shops who make websites for small businesses. I visit them as customers and ask too many questions&hellip; later on I did a market job with them in exchange for learning from their developer.</p>
<p>I learn about static - dynamic websites, CMS (wordpress, Dhrupal, Jhoomla), some basics about HTML CSS and PHP, what is domain, what is hosting and server. And most importantly how to do business of developing websites - profit margins and other stuff.</p>
<p>My first blog/website was called &lsquo;<strong>Pathak Technologies</strong>&rsquo;. Small web development firm<br>
it was on <strong>blogger/blogspot.com</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Around 2013 I moved to wordpress. At that time there was a big Gujarati blogger community on wordpress. Most of them are sitting in the USA or Canada and blogging about their retired life :)<br>
I remember Suresh dada&rsquo;s blog, Vinod bhai blog&hellip;</p>
<p>I also remember reading <a href="https://hirals.wordpress.com/">Hiral ben</a>, <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik bhai</a>, <a href="https://nirmalpathak.wordpress.com/">Nirmal bhai&rsquo;s blogs</a>.</p>
<p>I was running three blogs at that time -</p>
<ul>
<li>my personal blog called &lsquo;<a href="https://mihirism.wordpress.com/">Mihirism</a>&rsquo;</li>
<li>blog called <a href="https://sureshbjani.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/laboratory/">&lsquo;Prayog Ghar&rsquo;</a> about science &amp; technology in simple language</li>
<li>&lsquo;<a href="https://kelavani.wordpress.com/">Sanistha kelavani</a>&rsquo; about Nai taleem education</li>
<li>I was contributing on &lsquo;<a href="http://evidyalay.net/">Evidyalay</a>&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>it was wonderful learning time</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p><img src="/blogging/medium.png" alt="Medium"></p>
<p>I remember samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and something called &lsquo;<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>&rsquo; :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Medium was very new and silk that time. super clean writing focused blogging platform.</strong></em></p>
<p>I liked it immediately and made <a href="https://medium.com/@learningwala">my profile</a>. <strong>My last post on Medium was on Nov- 2023</strong></p>
<p>I wrote about my classroom experiences / learning experiments with children and teachers, I wrote about some interesting resources I found for educators / interesting stuff around pedagogy and more. mostly centred around education, philosophy and pedagogy . Sometimes some personal stuff like poems or life as an educator..</p>
<p><strong>in between, around 2015</strong></p>
<p>we (<a href="https://www.lakhan.me/">lakhan samani</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kash9350">kashyap</a> helped me a lot. very grateful for that - Thank you guys) have made &rsquo;learnlabs&rsquo; website in PHP</p>
<p><strong>Around 2018</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://jubinsblog.com/">Jubin</a> introduced me to wix.com - I made first version on &rsquo;learningwala.com&rsquo; on that</p>
<p><strong>I was using it till 2022</strong></p>
<p>During that time I shifted my blogging journey on <a href="https://instagram.com/learningwala">instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly because I was getting community over there. Educators, Artist and more. I mostly put posts about my experiments with children, workshops I am conducting with teachers, books I am reading, inspiring educators and more.</p>
<p><strong>till now 839 posts, 1132 followers</strong></p>
<p>oh, I forgot about facebook. I have been active on FB since 2010 (Remember UC Browser ??) till I got instagram. After instagram, facebook is running on auto pilot. All instagram posts auto publish on FB.</p>
<p>I tried IFTTT before this instagram feature came.</p>
<ul>
<li>I made some very good connections through <a href="https://instagram.com/learningwala">instagram</a> and facebook.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>After leaving wix for my personal website I shifted my stuff (projects, writing, CV, etc) on <a href="https://linktr.ee/learningwala">linktree</a>.</p>
<p>I made websites for friends on wix and still maintain it.</p>
<p>Since the last few months I have had the desire to start my blogging journey again. With more categories in writing like weekly notes, ideas for project based learning / nature based learning and some other experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Medium is now paid for. You can&rsquo;t read unlimited stories.</strong> I started exploring other platforms<br>
Ghost, Wordpress, there is a long list of minimal blogging platforms. Some are giving self hosting facilities.</p>
<p>I was looking for a super minimal platform where I can just write posts and I have control on my data.<br>
no advertisement, monetisation of posts, no social network around blog, - just writing place</p>
<p>Someone suggested trying <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and Github pages. It was too geeky for me. I tried two - three themes but never started writing on it.</p>
<p>I found something called <a href="bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a></p>
<p>Basically, someone developed a back-end to update your static site. It is perfect for minimal blogging<br>
but it is not available for self hosting, what if this project got stopped ? What if the product strategy of this platform changes ?</p>
<p>But I really like the theme. I searched more and luckily I found the same theme on github which was available self hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> / <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> / your own server.</p>
<p>Finally I saw two youtube videos and learned how to set it. <strong>And yes I am writing on the same platform :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="low-tech-website">Low tech website</h2>
<p><em>This website too simple, ugly, no modern features</em></p>
<p>And no Js, No cookies, no tracker, fast, clean, functional, you own the data, you can develop in your own ways, less energy usage, less computing power usage</p>
<p><strong>let&rsquo;s find why, what and How about low tech website :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-09-27/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/">- How to Build a Low-tech Website?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lente.dev/en/posts/stone-websites/">- Stone websites</a></p>
<p><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">- This Page is Designed to Last</a></p>
<p><strong>My ultimate dream is to host my own static site on solar powered raspberry pi<br>
someday I will do it for sure.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
