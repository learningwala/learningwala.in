  <h4 id="7th-to-14th-sep-2024">7th to 14th Sep 2024</h4>
<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>saturday evening Mitali ben came home and had a talk with Me and Nidhi sapratly
after that we went to padra, had a talk with my parents. Main three things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>golu should not live here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi should come padra often (once a week) and help mummy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to save money / they needed some financial clearity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>meeting went well.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sunday morning me and Nidhi came to padra, satyed till evening. Evening we (Mihir, Nidhi, Golu) went to SAF (sai&rsquo;s angel foundation)
one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; I have praposed two ideas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture</li>
<li>tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do</li>
</ol>
<p>most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children&rsquo;s enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.</p>
<p>I shifited back to padra.</p>
<p><strong>Monday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work. In evening I met <a href="https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/nihar-pandya">Nihar Pandya</a> at Gulmahor</li>
<li>My blood presure got down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to hospital</li>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to nidhi&rsquo;d place and worked form there.</li>
<li>it was difficult day for me. First of telling at home that I want to go at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. I was anxious. At nidhi&rsquo;s place it was difficult for me to listen golu&rsquo;s voice. I don&rsquo;t like the rude tone and other thing is whole routine stuff.. I can&rsquo;t see him like this. I shouldn&rsquo;t give this option of gap year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what else ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I randomly did msg to Yogen shah, wrong decision. His is just like I met him for so 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratham work is going good. Now I am confident about writing script, making poster and editing / making video in canva.
For canva part I still take help of Archi and Neha. They are pro. I need to play more with canva to make it normal for me. Just like I tinker with my website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sunday khoji club will not happen. I need to go for prayer of one relative. But children are very very excited. They ready with their tasks.
I see big hope to this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early bird approached for facilitating birdwalk in Vadodara. I am not sure we will able to do it or not. I will take final call today and email them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am learning to balance my time between work, Nidhi&rsquo;s place and parents place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Thursday I saw documentary on swami brahmvedantaji again. This is like 5th or 6th time. This I understood what is &lsquo;self - remembering&rsquo; and what is the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો હોંશ થી કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં તમારી હાજરી રહે એવી રીતે કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં પણ રહેવાનું છે અને સાથે સાથે આપણું મૂળ સ્વરૂપ પણ યાદ રાખવાનું છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there is real self without any filters. our ego is making this suffering more difficult.
we need to remember our true self each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too much gyan. It is simple practice.</p>
