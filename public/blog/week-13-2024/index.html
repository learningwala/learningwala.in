<content>
  <p>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.
I was in constant stress about Nidhi&rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..</p>
<p>On the other side communication - coordination with parents about engagement planning is going on. They are not happy that we are moving to pune without any financial security.</p>
<p>Yesterday Nidhi went to Pune for interviews and visited a few alternative schools. I am praying, hoping something will work out. Over friend Nirmala is getting enage on 12th so we are planning if we can attend the function while coming back from Pune.</p>

<img src="/w13/anand.jpeg" alt="Anand"></p>
<ul>
<li>On thursday I met Anand Chitipothu at Indian Coffee House, Church Street.
I read about him on <a href="https://yourstory.com/2014/09/techie-tuesdays-anand-chitipothu">yourstory - Techie Tuesdays - 2014</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I redescoverd about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> recently I was remembering other techies in this ethos. I remembered Anand&rsquo;s website because of its unique name <a href="https://anandology.com/">&lsquo;anandology&rsquo;</a>. I visited his website and surprisingly I found that he worked with Aaron on an infogami, Open library project and he contributed to the Web.py framework.  I immediately emailed him that I want to meet you. He promptly replied and we met.</p>
<p>I was part of a python elective course on python at beme. And I have been exploring scratch since 2013.
so I wanted to talk about teaching programming to children.
I wanted to talk about his work with aaron and open source world in general</p>
<h4 id="--teaching-programming-to-children">- Teaching Programming to children  </h4>
<p>What we have talked :
 </p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching Programmer mindset instead of only programming tools or language , learning programmer&rsquo;s mindset through origami / paper folding</li>
<li>we talked about his exploration with children at CFL and other schools, <a href="https://anandology.com/practical-computing/">Practical computing course</a></li>

<li>limitation of MIT Scratch</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--introducing-concept-of-foss-to-children">- Introducing concept of FOSS to children</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>he said we should not start sharing examples of software or linux if we want to introduce the open source world to children. We should take any daily life problem and solve that problem with children and that&rsquo;s how we should introduce..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said in India the concept of sharing, concept of community is different. So it is a little difficult to introduce the open source world here.  </p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>I shared my idea to make a solar powered low tech website and he promised to help me with that :)</p>
