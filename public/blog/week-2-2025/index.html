<p>9th : Sakha lunch meeting. We (Ashish bhai, Rameshwari ben, Nikita ben, Saurabh bhai, Nidhi, Mihir sajid bhai ) went to kathivadi darbar. it was super fun.

</ul>
<p>they were student of alternative school near rajkot / chotila calle &lsquo;K shala&rsquo;. I use to do BA sociology from surastra university around 2017. During that time I use to visit this school. Bharat came to my place when I was working in Bhuj. I was so happy to see them after so many years. Our relationship was not like teacher - students. We are friends. I am so happy that they are now working with children and trying to create environment which they got during k shala. They also shared the updates about other students that they are doing well in their respective fields and some of them are getting married soon.</p>
<p>chetan is in ahemdabad running organic milk startup with Srishti (Prof Anil)

Vibhu is also working in nisarg upchar kendra
Nikunj is not doing anything as per them :)

Harshad is interested in mountaineering and he is working as guide for different groups</p>
<p>Bharat and Dhara are going to work at shishukunj foundation, Bhuj. They are going to work with children from gov schools. Me &amp; Nidhi were thinking to visit them and do some nature education work with them. I felt that they are thinking limited scope of work like doing games and art activity with children. We can do lot more. We will talk to them. I it just thought, I never seen them working so I might be wrong.</p>
