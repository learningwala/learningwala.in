<li>I write weekly notes, blog posts and maintain this website. (<a href="/colophon/">Colophon</a> for this website)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wish list + Work on pause :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Documenting my past work and write articles about the same (How about seeing BLR, Time exhibition, Voice of vishwamitri, local khoji)</li>
<li>Developing module / workshop around &lsquo;Geo inquiry projects&rsquo; or Using maps for geo inquiry projects&rsquo;</li>
<li>Working on activity module on nature education for kindergarten children</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I’ve been thinking of taking a break from my full-time job for about 2–3 months to engage in an internship or volunteer with meaningful projects.</p>
<p>I’m especially interested in research, interventions, or facilitation work around the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nature education</li>
<li>Development of environmental aesthetic sense, especially from an Indic perspective</li>
<li>Exploration of the affective domain with primary grade children</li>
<li>Project-based and integrated learning approaches in early childhood education</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything related to environmental education, Aesthetics, Indic Perspective, Neuroscience</p>
<p>There are no monetary expectations from my side for this project. Since I haven’t been part of formal college education, I’ve felt the need over the years to find learning opportunities beyond professional, outcome-driven roles. I long for a phase where I can simply be a student again.</p>
<p>(I have started one learning journey with <a href="https://www.sriviliveshere.com/">Dr.Srivi Kalyan</a> on above topics. I will update more detail soon)</p>
