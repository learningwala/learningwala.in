<p>In early childhood education, language is often treated as a technical skill—letters first, sounds next, grammar rules soon after. But children do not enter the world thinking in alphabets or sentence structures. They enter the world <strong>experiencing meaning</strong>—through the body, emotions, relationships, and action.</p>
<p>This is where the idea of <strong>semantic grammar</strong> becomes important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-what-is-semantic-grammar">1. What is Semantic Grammar?</h2>
<h3 id="and-how-is-it-different-from-chomskys-universal-grammar">And how is it different from Chomsky’s Universal Grammar?</h3>
<p><strong>Semantic grammar</strong> refers to the <strong>universal structures of meaning</strong> that all humans share, regardless of the language they speak. These are not rules of sentence formation, but <strong>patterns of understanding</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is doing something (agent)</li>
<li>What is happening (action)</li>
<li>What is affected (object)</li>
<li>Cause and effect</li>
<li>Time (before, after, now)</li>
<li>Space (inside, outside, near, far)</li>
<li>Emotion, intention, relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>Every human language expresses these ideas, even though the words and grammar may differ. A child understands <em>“someone pushed, something fell, it hurt”</em> long before they can say it in a grammatically correct sentence.</p>
<p>This is <strong>very different</strong> from Noam Chomsky’s idea of <strong>Universal Grammar</strong>, which focuses on <strong>innate syntactic rules</strong>—how sentences are structured in the mind. Chomsky’s work is concerned with <strong>form</strong>; semantic grammar is concerned with <strong>meaning</strong>.</p>
<p>In simple terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chomsky asks:</strong> How are sentences formed?</li>
<li><strong>Semantic grammar asks:</strong> How does meaning arise?</li>
</ul>
<p>For young children, meaning always comes first.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-why-is-it-important-to-work-on-semantic-grammar-with-children-ages-36">2. Why is it important to work on semantic grammar with children (ages 3–6)?</h2>
<p>Between the ages of <strong>3 to 6</strong>, children are building their <strong>inner map of the world</strong>. They are learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>How actions lead to consequences</li>
<li>How people relate to each other</li>
<li>How emotions feel in the body</li>
<li>How time and space work</li>
<li>How intentions differ from outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>This learning does not happen through explanation. It happens through <strong>lived experience</strong>.</p>
<p>When we support semantic grammar at this age, we are strengthening:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence</li>
<li>Social understanding</li>
<li>Curiosity and inquiry</li>
<li>Confidence in expression</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-work-with-semantic-grammar-36-years">How to work with semantic grammar (3–6 years)</h3>
<p>At this age, the focus should be on <strong>experience → reflection → expression</strong>, not on correctness.</p>
<p><strong>Some simple ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action-based play:</strong> pushing, pulling, pouring, building, breaking
(“What changed?” “What happened next?”)</li>
<li><strong>Story without text:</strong> picture sequences, puppets, role play
(“Who did this?” “Why?”)</li>
<li><strong>Nature observation:</strong> ants carrying food, leaves falling, water flowing
(“What is it doing?” “What happens if…?”)</li>
<li><strong>Emotion naming through experience:</strong>
(“Your body looks tight—are you feeling angry?”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Language emerges naturally when meaning is clear.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-why-teaching-phonics-and-grammar-is-not-good-pedagogy-at-this-age">3. Why teaching phonics and grammar is not good pedagogy at this age</h2>
<p>Phonics and formal grammar focus on <strong>symbol systems</strong>—letters, sounds, sentence rules. But for young children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their thinking is <strong>concrete and embodied</strong></li>
<li>Their learning is <strong>implicit</strong>, not analytical</li>
<li>Their attention is driven by <strong>curiosity</strong>, not abstraction</li>
</ul>
<p>When we push phonics and grammar too early:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children may learn to decode without understanding</li>
<li>Language becomes performance-oriented</li>
<li>Fear of mistakes enters learning</li>
<li>Expression becomes narrower, not richer</li>
</ul>
<p>This does <strong>not</strong> mean phonics or grammar are wrong.
It means they are <strong>developmentally mistimed</strong>.</p>
<p>Without a strong foundation of meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading becomes mechanical</li>
<li>Writing becomes formulaic</li>
<li>Language loses joy</li>
</ul>
<p>Children need to <strong>live language</strong> before they study it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-semantic-grammar-and-implicit-learning">4. Semantic grammar and implicit learning</h2>
<h3 id="and-how-to-make-it-explicit-later-gently">And how to make it explicit (later, gently)</h3>
<p>Semantic grammar is learned <strong>implicitly</strong>—through repeated experiences, patterns, and relationships. Children absorb meaning without being taught rules.</p>
<p>This is not a weakness; it is a strength.</p>
<p>Implicit learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is deep and long-lasting</li>
<li>Does not create pressure</li>
<li>Allows each child to move at their own pace</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-how-do-we-make-it-explicit">So how do we make it explicit?</h3>
<p><strong>Not by worksheets or explanations</strong>, but through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection (“What did you notice?”)</li>
<li>Storytelling (“Tell me what happened”)</li>
<li>Drawing and mapping</li>
<li>Revisiting experiences</li>
<li>Gentle naming of patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>After many experiences of cause and effect, a child begins to say “because”</li>
<li>After many shared stories, sentence structure stabilizes on its own</li>
<li>Grammar becomes visible <strong>after meaning is stable</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Explicit learning should <strong>emerge from lived experience</strong>, not replace it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Young children do not need to be taught language as a system.
They need to be supported in <strong>making sense of the world</strong>.</p>
<p>When meaning is strong, language follows naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Semantic grammar reminds us that education is not about filling children with correct words, but about helping them discover and express what they already understand.</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Grammar should enter education not as a set of rules to be mastered, but as a reflective tool that helps children notice, refine, and deepen the meanings they are already living.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Children’s literature, theatre, and libraries do not teach language; they cultivate the soil in which language, thought, and social understanding can grow.</p></blockquote>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most education systems are very good at answering two questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What does a child know?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What can a child do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But a far more important question often remains invisible:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the child care about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question lives in the affective domain of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-affective-domain-of-learning&#34;&gt;What is the affective domain of learning?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The affective domain refers to learning related to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;emotions and feelings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;attitudes and dispositions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;values and ethics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;motivation and interest&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;empathy, care, and sense of belonging&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is one of the three domains of learning:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most education systems are very good at answering two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does a child know?</li>
<li>What can a child do?</li>
</ul>
<p>But a far more important question often remains invisible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What does the child care about?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The answer to this question lives in the affective domain of learning.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-the-affective-domain-of-learning">What is the affective domain of learning?</h2>
<p>The affective domain refers to learning related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotions and feelings</li>
<li>attitudes and dispositions</li>
<li>values and ethics</li>
<li>motivation and interest</li>
<li>empathy, care, and sense of belonging</li>
</ul>
<p>It is one of the three domains of learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive – thinking, knowing, understanding</li>
<li>Psychomotor – doing, making, physical skills</li>
<li>Affective – feeling, valuing, relating</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If cognitive learning shapes the mind and psychomotor learning shapes the body, affective learning shapes the inner compass of a child.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not about teaching “good behaviour” or inserting moral lessons.<br>
It is about how meaning, care, and values slowly form through lived experience.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-is-the-affective-domain-important">Why is the affective domain important?</h2>
<p>Because without it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge remains detached</li>
<li>Skills become mechanical</li>
<li>Ethics turn into obedience</li>
<li>Learning loses depth and joy</li>
</ul>
<p>Affective learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>builds intrinsic motivation</li>
<li>nurtures empathy and social awareness</li>
<li>supports identity formation</li>
<li>develops ethical reasoning</li>
<li>allows children to hold complexity and ambiguity</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In a world shaped by polarisation, propaganda, and speed, children do not need more answers — they need sensitivity, discernment, and inner freedom.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="affective-learning-is-not-value-education">Affective learning is not “value education”</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional value education:</p>
<ul>
<li>outcomes are not pre-decided</li>
<li>feelings are not corrected</li>
<li>agreement is not expected</li>
</ul>
<p>Affective learning does not tell children what to value.<br>
It helps them understand how valuing happens.</p>
<p>This distinction protects it from becoming indoctrination.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-affective-learning-unfolds-ages-315">How affective learning unfolds (ages 3–15)</h2>
<p>Affective learning looks different at different ages, but the principles remain the same.</p>
<h3 id="ages-36--feeling-safe-sensing-the-world">Ages 3–6 | Feeling safe, sensing the world</h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety</li>
<li>sensory awareness</li>
<li>basic empathy</li>
<li>aesthetic appreciation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>free play</li>
<li>stories without moral explanations</li>
<li>music, movement, rhythm</li>
<li>nature walks with time to pause</li>
<li>naming feelings without judgement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
A child sits quietly watching ants instead of being rushed to “learn about insects.”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ages-710--belonging-care-curiosity">Ages 7–10 | Belonging, care, curiosity</h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>relationships</li>
<li>fairness</li>
<li>curiosity about others</li>
<li>emotional expression</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>collaborative tasks</li>
<li>shared responsibility (plants, materials, space)</li>
<li>reflective conversations</li>
<li>drawing, journaling, theatre</li>
<li>meeting people and listening to their stories</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Children argue during a group task and are supported to reflect rather than punished.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ages-1115--identity-ethics-meaning">Ages 11–15 | Identity, ethics, meaning</h3>
<p><strong>Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>identity formation</li>
<li>ethical dilemmas</li>
<li>justice and power</li>
<li>belonging and difference</li>
<li>agency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>real-world inquiry projects</li>
<li>dialogue circles</li>
<li>community engagement</li>
<li>reflective writing</li>
<li>theatre, debate, role reversal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
Young people explore a local issue without being told what position to take.</p>

<p>You don’t “teach” these topics — you work with them.</p>
<h3 id="1-relationship-with-self">1. Relationship with Self</h3>

<p>Affective learning is not an “extra” or a “soft skill.”<br>
It is the ground on which all meaningful learning stands.</p>

I would be delighted to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It&rsquo;s Teacher&rsquo;s Day, and I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Just as a musician has their riyaz (daily practice), and a writer has theirs, what would you say is the riyaz of a teacher? What should a teacher engage in every day—not tied to any particular subject or grade, but as a practice of life itself? Could you share 2–3 such practices that you personally follow? I would be delighted to hear them.</p>
<p>I want to give more interesting prompt. Think about something which is not directly connected to classroom teaching.. for example doing yoga or doing nothing for 10 min everyday.. will that help in my interaction with children? Think about looking the same tree every day.. will that help&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="responses-">Responses :</h2>
<h3 id="srivi">Srivi</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just the act of listening without being clouded by judgement or one&rsquo;s own emotions, I think is a good practice.</li>
<li>Being honest with yourself and not trying to be perfect, and acknowledging that teaching-learning is hard work, and you will have your own disappointments and frustrations, anger and fear and not trying to underplay these, but discussing them with the right peers or with students thoughtfully.</li>
<li>Keep learning something for yourself, something that you enjoy, not because u want to teach it</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mahendra-sir">Mahendra sir</h3>
<ul>
<li>મનુષ્યનાં વર્તનોને સમજવા માટે આંતરવિદ્યાશાખાકીય પ્રયાસ</li>

<li>નાનાથી માંડીને મોટા લોકો સાથે જિજ્ઞાસાપૂર્વક વાતચીત</li>
<li>રમૂજ અને અગંભીરતા દ્વારા આનંદ</li>
<li>ટીવી, ફોન, સોશિયલ મીડિયાનો ન્યૂનતમ ઉપયોગ</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chetana">Chetana</h3>
<p>Read, meditate, gardening :)</p>
<h3 id="disha">Disha</h3>
<ol>
<li>Plan your class well, but be ready to improvise, always.</li>
<li>Read about current affairs relevant to the kids to strike a conversation with them</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="antara">Antara</h3>
<p>There are a few things I can think of -</p>
<p>Practicing gratitude and acknowledgement of the elements like sun, water and air not just in my head but when I am interacting with them&hellip;</p>
<p>Listening practice on my terrace - Birds sounds</p>
<p>Observations - plants, insects, worms, in my garden..
I also like to smell for unique smells in the dried fruits, leaves or compost bin,
I like to imagine and name the smells - amonia or sulphur
Hahaha&hellip;
Mostly this is my routine in the morning&hellip;</p>
<p>Current fascination is fermentation&hellip;and colour making</p>
<p>It directly connects to doing some exploration or experiments during nature walks&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; Also challenge them for what&rsquo;s bad, ugly, and keep a look out for hidden phenomena</p>
<p>When ( time of the day) the sun rays are soft on our skin warm and not hot vs. when the skin burns&hellip; transition from warm to hot&hellip; Experiencing it was fun For children</p>
<p>On the same line I chanced upon atmospherics in paintings and how monet use to paint only in a certain light and switched canvas as soon as the light changed&hellip;.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a city folk&hellip;I find it very challenging to come from a space of rest/settled state&hellip;</p>
<p>I also try affirmations in the morning -
Asking the universal will to attune me to what I need to attend today.
It&rsquo;s helpful the days I do it&hellip;</p>
<p>Lately I have realised most city folk are challenged by negative self talk and poor self care habits&hellip;</p>
<p>We are drowned in this condition and we just bounce around spilling it in the environment.. mostly unknowingly</p>
<h3 id="seema-hegde">Seema Hegde</h3>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>I had a teacher from my college, who is retired now, he used to say, one should always be up to date with the information. He was an exception among other elder teachers who would come to class without study and just blabber old, outdated things.</p>
<p>I think riyaz to a teacher (at least for me) is to refresh the lesson plan, no matter how many times it has been taught in previous years. There is always something new, which can be added this year.</p>
<p>Also, a teacher should always go beyond textbooks, experience hands on, expand their own knowledge, and in turn create interest in students.</p>
<p>For this, I follow a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading magazines</li>
<li>Learning with students, especially while answering their questions. You see one question leads to many new things,, its like a chain reaction</li>
<li>Doing things myself</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="samyak-bhuta">Samyak Bhuta</h3>

<p>Good morning,
Beautiful question.</p>
<p>The first thing I practise every morning is <strong>&ldquo;NETI NETI&rdquo;</strong> recognising all the roles I play and remind myself I am beyond all of that, I mediate on the chants of nirvan shatakam every morning.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I take full responsibility of myself, my mind, my emotions and my body. I practise yoga 3 times a week, I dance, I go for walks, I am very particular about my diet (I let go fully when I am travelling or on a vacation)
I spend good time in nature, parks, rivers, ocean .. all of these rejuvenate me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I READ, I read a lot. All kinds of topics, I don&rsquo;t complete a lot of books if there don&rsquo;t hold my interest but I do explore. I also listen to podcast and audio books when I go for walks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love my family, very very deeply and I look after their needs, that keep me anchored and does not allow the rest of the things become centre stage.
I have very few friends but they are my life lines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Above all I keep a check on my self - Am I Happy, if not, then I check on what is the entanglement and I go back to <strong>&ldquo;SHIVOHAM- SHIVOHAM&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Who is A Teacher?</strong></p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo clearly mentions that the first principle of true teaching is that nothing can be taught! What then is the role of the teacher?</p>
<p>A teacher is a role model, who points the way for students to unfold the knowledge that lies deep within them. Makes space for exploration, stays present and caring through many trials and mistakes and helps unfold wisdom that lies within. A Compassionate guide who holds space for self growth and learning to unfold. Helping students reflect and come to understanding within oneself. Who believes in each child&rsquo;s potential and helps children see this!</p>
<p>Being a teacher is a path of yoga, of hard work, self discipline, self development and cultivating compassion for others. Teaching is a Sadhana that can lead one to self mastery.</p>
<p>Let us take back the dignity of this role - from just teaching a skill to holding a compassionate space for the unfolding of ourselves and the young souls in our lives!</p>
<p>Happy teachers day!</p>

<p>Happy Teacher&rsquo;s Day!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the most important daily practices that I follow and I think every teacher should follow or think/ write/ make a voice note about how their day went and reflect upon it, what worked what did not work. This would involve how they felt when certain instances happened or when they were dealing with a particular child. As it helps, you plan for the next class, understand the child and yourself better which in turn helps you be a better teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think many of the teachers do this as a practice- to read or watch videos that would help you understand the age group of children you&rsquo;re handling, or more about your subject. Anything that can help you upskill yourself. This can also happen in a form discussion with your colleague. Not daily I would say but at least weekly once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily no matter how many classes you have facilitated to always go prepared and planned. To make a rough sketch of how you want to take things into class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, to have a support group could be your colleagues/ family/ friends to share your frustrations without getting judged. It&rsquo;s important for your mental and emotional well-being as a teacher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them are just basic things which many of the teachers follow. The last one I think is also important and at times neglected. Teaching and dealing with children is not always rosy.</p>
<p>I hope I answered your question.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Response:</strong>
Connected to my last point, yes, it would help.</p>
<p>To engage in your interest it could be drawing, taking a walk or as you said doing absolutely nothing. I do have an hour after I come from school and just lie down to decompress for an hour. Of course, it will be subjective depending upon the person&rsquo;s personality and interests.</p>
<p>Dancing is another go-to for me. Once in two months or at times every month when I feel overwhelmed or overworked, dancing helps me regulate.</p>

<p>When I used to work with children, it gradually became very important for me to go back to school after dinner, around 6-7 pm when the girls had more time to themselves. To chat, meet, read together, work on library stuff, to do extra padhai. It became very important to be with them when neither of us were under pressure to conform to a role, a task or a value.</p>
<p>It greatly affected how I carried myself in school the next day, how I persisted getting over the resentment in what I felt school as a deeply conflicting space.</p>

<p>Hey! Such an insightful question..</p>
<p>For me - constantly learning myself is a non-negotiable.
Which requires myriad inputs - books, travel, conversations, courses, podcasts etc</p>
<p>Hence <strong>practice 1</strong> - Life-long learning.</p>
<p>The other is, reflection and reflective action.
Cumulative time to look back and constant awareness of actions as I perform them.</p>
<p>So <strong>practice 2</strong> is - Reflection and awareness (of self and other)</p>
<h3 id="all-about-child">All about child</h3>
<p>First of all Happy Teachers Day! Hmmm this made me think 🤔. Meditation is very important to keep a calm demeanour. Leave all your negative baggage behind before entering the school/ work space. Always keep the attitude of learning from your students.</p>
<h3 id="nav-nidhi">Nav Nidhi</h3>
<p>Spending time with children, be interested in them, loving them respecting them. I find this the most important. When this happens and when a connection is made, a lot of many things will start coming to the surface. I feel its also a process which unfolds in its own time and hence one shouldn&rsquo;t hurry. Dont take yourself too seriously, someone who is very knowledgeable and knows the best for the children, this attitude always comes in the way we relate.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="deborah">Deborah</h3>
<p>Hi Mihir, thanks for sharing the question. I would love to hear your thoughts on this, too.</p>
<p>In comparing a teacher to a writer, or a musician, there are implicit assumptions of teaching being akin to an art, more specifically, a performing art. The specific content of what they teach is actually secondary to how they are able to interact with, and motivate students. This is a reason why subject expertise doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make one a good teacher, who is not dealing with empty containers to be filled with knowledge, but people with rich, complex inner lives who should feel motivated to learn.</p>
<p>This makes teaching a particularly hard occupation (I won&rsquo;t go into the issues of conventional teacher training which is still running with a factory model of education). I do believe teaching is a calling, and suitable only to specific temperaments (whether these can be learned would be another discussion).</p>
<p>The core of teaching lies in deep empathy, and developing the skill to channelise it into specific forms of teaching. How then to continuously develop this empathy? I think it comes from the practice of daily attention and reflection. Many good teachers maintain journals outlining their daily practices, and that becomes its own piece of learning over the years. Through such reflexive practices, they are able to hone the innate knack of teaching into an intuitive skill.</p>
<h3 id="sahmata">Sahmata</h3>
<ul>
<li>Listening</li>
<li>Critical reflection</li>
<li>Observing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rachna-mam---msu">Rachna Mam - MSU</h3>
<p>Very interesting questions, thank you! Don&rsquo;t think anyone is interested in teachers or teaching processes in such depth these days 😁</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An important daily practice that never quite ends is preparing for class. That includes content mastery and upgrade, time planning and pedagogical preparation. How can the same concept be taught using 2-3 methods or approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Openness to curiosity of students as well as being curious oneself - this is tied to mastery. Once you master the content, it opens doors to more questions and more thinking out of the box using the same mastery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating whether students have understood and received content without dependence only on exams or tests. This helps in fine tuning content as per interest and pitching your teaching at an appropriate level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathy and discipline need not be separated or seen as opposites&hellip;.but as a daily practice entails mostly listening fully without bias.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mitali-baxi">Mitali Baxi</h3>
<p>To me, this reyaz means:
To work on own self much deeper, much objectively.
Means, to grow cooler and cooler day by day by being more accepting, by understanding difference between expectations and real needs - of life.</p>
<p>I understand that when I grow wide, my increased compassion and acceptance connects me more with students and with all the people around children.</p>
<p>One more riyaz is to challenge own knowledge continuously to learn better for making students learn better.</p>
<p>What a beautiful question you asked!</p>
<p><strong>For everyday practice:</strong>
Reflection about the whole day is the key.
For that, I dine around 6.30 pm, turn off my internet after 8 pm.
And go to sleep between 10 and 10.30.</p>
<p>Also, whenever I get upset about anything, I start reflecting on it right in that moment.</p>
<p>(Till date I have found that any irritation has its root in me and only I can overcome it; the outer conditions are not at fault.)</p>
<h3 id="radika">Radika</h3>
<p>For me, it has been self reflection so far.</p>
<p>Another one,
Observing children, Noticing how they think, what excites them, where they struggle or what is something they don&rsquo;t like. Watching with curiosity rather than judgement</p>
<h3 id="bansari">Bansari</h3>
<p>For me it is otherwise around I think because I do some practices as a person or as a human being, and those practices makes me teacher.</p>
<p>The most important practice is to understand that everyone&rsquo;s reality is different there experience is a different and so the knowledge and their perception is. I practice this with all age groups. This practice also helps me to see every age groups as equal human beings.</p>
<p>Whenever I am asking a teach with a learning group, I do practice to put my self as I am. Also try to break stereotype of conventional teaching learning processes and perception of how a teacher is.</p>
<h3 id="muskan">Muskan</h3>
<p>What a lovely question :)</p>
<p>Happy Teacher&rsquo;s Day Mihir! 😁</p>
<p>For me, reading something and doing some form of exercise for physical fitness are 2 important practices.</p>
<p>Reading opens up my mind, and is fun!
Physical fitness helps balance my emotions, and thus allows me to understand myself &amp; others better :)</p>
<h3 id="suraj">Suraj</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting and takes a deep thinking</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuous Learning, upgrading knowledge, attending training, reading, reflecting&hellip;</li>
<li>Adjusting methods when something isn&rsquo;t work&hellip; Should have multiple methods to teach or learn&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p>These are from my side 😊</p>
<h3 id="pratika">Pratika</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Roz naya kuchh padhte rehna. Har mamle mai updated nahi raha ja sakta. Lekin jitna jyada raha ja sakta hai utna rehna. Naya padhna naye ideas deta hai, naya nazariya deta hai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teacher ke role ki practice karna</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Teacher koi insaan hota hai. Aur har insaan ke apne belief hote hai. Ab chunki wo teacher hai buae poori tarah un belief se bhare teacher ae alag nahi kar sakte. Wo teacher samaj ke 10 aur role mai hota hai, sambhav nahi aesa karna. Lekin as a teacher uski kya bhumikaye hai, ye use yaad karte rehna chahiye, taki uske niji vishwas aur mantaye uske kaam pe havi na ho.</p>
<p>Jo kinaam taur pe har teacher ke ho hi jati hai.</p>
<p>Tabhi schools mai saraswati pooja ya admission nke time ygya-hawan hote hai. Ameer gareeb bachcho ke sath bhedbhaav hote hai. Apne role ko nibhane ki practice.</p>
<h3 id="deeksha">Deeksha</h3>
<p>Hey Mihir,</p>
<p>Apologies for the late reply.</p>
<p>I think first thing for me is to bring myself back to the point where everything originated for me. Which is to ask is my work making way for more sensitivity and does it helps myself and others to understand the vast interconnectedness and expance of life, or does it merely conditions others with my point of view, making the mind dull and narrow.</p>
<p>Second thing is to not put myself at pedestal, especially when I am with kids. I try to learn with them. Thigh I miss many times.</p>
<p>Thirds is a fairely new one, as a result of realisation of socio economic injustice, I tend to draw away form places which serve only class. Which  is happening more and more into alternate spaces.</p>
<p>I thing quality education is for all and it should reach every child. Though it becomes difficult because ai have to earn and privileged space are usually the one paying teachers well.  But I tend to be aware of it, even if I have to do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>At this age, skills are given in seed form — not as formal training but through play, rhythm, imitation, and imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teacher/parent’s role is to model beauty, order, joy → the child “absorbs” the Kalās naturally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Kalās that in Indian tradition appear as refined arts (music, crafts, riddles) are given through playful, child-suitable forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can includes some things as long term practice, some things as one of exposures. For example we can include art, hand work, music, drama in schedule as long term practice. Weaving cloth kind of thing as one of learning experience / project theme.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;version-1---simple-&#34;&gt;Version 1 - simple :&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our true nature is a state of inner joy, peace, clarity, and connection — where we feel light, open, and deeply at home in ourselves and with the world. A person living from this true nature acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, we are not able to live in this space every moment because our mind gets clouded by avidyā — ignorance of who we really are — which shows up as old habits, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that cover our inner light. Vidyā, or true knowledge, is the process of clearing these clouds so the sun of our real self can shine naturally. To do this, we walk paths that engage the whole being through the Panchakosha framework: yoga practices to align body, breath, and mind; the 64 kalās to refine our senses, skills, and creativity; and Rasa theory to understand and harmonize our emotions. Together, these tools help children and adults alike live more and more from their true nature, moment to moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Our true nature is a state of inner joy, peace, clarity, and connection — where we feel light, open, and deeply at home in ourselves and with the world. A person living from this true nature acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, we are not able to live in this space every moment because our mind gets clouded by avidyā — ignorance of who we really are — which shows up as old habits, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that cover our inner light. Vidyā, or true knowledge, is the process of clearing these clouds so the sun of our real self can shine naturally. To do this, we walk paths that engage the whole being through the Panchakosha framework: yoga practices to align body, breath, and mind; the 64 kalās to refine our senses, skills, and creativity; and Rasa theory to understand and harmonize our emotions. Together, these tools help children and adults alike live more and more from their true nature, moment to moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-2-">Version 2 :</h2>
<p>Our Ātman — the innermost Self — is identical with Brahman, the infinite reality. In its pure state, it is sat–chit–ānanda: existence, consciousness, and bliss. Living in awareness of this Self feels like natural joy, peace, clarity, and connection — a sense of being fully at home in oneself and in harmony with the universe. One who abides in this realization acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life from presence rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, this abiding awareness is often veiled by avidyā — ignorance of our true identity as Ātman–Brahman — manifesting as old patterns, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that obscure our inner light. Vidyā, or liberating knowledge, is the process of removing these coverings so the radiance of the Self shines unobstructed.</p>
<p>For children aged 3–8, education can nurture this natural awareness by protecting their curiosity, guiding their emotions, and helping them explore the world with wonder rather than fear. Through the Panchakosha framework, yoga can help them develop body–mind awareness and calm breathing; the 64 kalās can be introduced as age-appropriate creative arts and life skills to refine senses and expression; and Rasa theory can guide activities that help them recognize, name, and balance emotions. In this way, early learning does not just transfer information but cultivates a child’s wholeness — allowing them to grow without losing touch with their true Self, so that the seed of Ātman–Brahman awareness can flourish throughout life.</p>

      <title>Indian Art &amp; Aesthetics</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently watched :</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fRcsXvgAM24?si=MdJmDzpCO3lcJ_oq">Master class on Indian Art and Aesthetics by Udayan Vajpeyii</a></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>My takeaway :</strong> The role of aesthetics in Indian thought is to evoke rasa — the emotional essence that touches the heart deeply. This rasa becomes a gateway to self-awareness, inviting you to notice what is happening inside you as you watch, listen, or experience something.</p>
<p>When you are able to give full attention to that inner movement, viveka (discernment) or prajñā (wisdom) begins to awaken. From this awakening, your actions can emerge from a dhārmik space — not just in a moral or religious sense, but in alignment with inner truth, right relationship, and the greater harmony of life.</p>
<p>To live dhārmikly, then, is to stay close to what is alive within you. In this, art and aesthetics become tools of inner refinement. They make you sensitive — not only to the outer world, but also to the subtle stirrings of your own being</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Abhinavagupta:</strong> who saw rasa as a pathway to śānta rasa (peace), the highest aesthetic and spiritual state.</p>
<p><strong>Tagore:</strong> who wrote about sahaj saundarya — a spontaneous aesthetic that brings inner harmony.</p>
<p><strong>Anand Coomaraswamy:</strong> who said, “The artist is not a special kind of man, but every man is a special kind of artist when he is in tune with his own dharma.”</p>

<p>Tantra is not black magic :)</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-tantra-">Principles of tantra :</h3>
<ul>
<li>પૃથ્વી પરના જીવન - રંગ, રસ , રૂપ માં જે આનંદ લે છે.. ઉત્સવ બનાવે છે.</li>
<li>જીવનને સમગ્રતા થી સ્વીકાર કરે છે. ઉજાસ ને સ્વીકારે છે.</li>
<li>તંત્ર ડેમોક્રેટિક છે. બધાનો સ્વીકાર છે. જાતિ, જેન્ડર, ધર્મ, અમીર - ગરીબ</li>
<li>વિઘ્નો સાધન છે. યાત્રા સાધ્ય છે. વિઘ્નો સાધના નો ભાગ છે. વિઘ્નો તમને વધુ મજબૂત બનાવે છે.</li>
<li>આ ક્રિયા યોગ છે. અશક્તિ વિનાનો આનંદ છે. આનંદ માટે નીકળ્યા હોય ત્યારે નામ ન પૂછો. જીવનમાં સમગ્રતા થી ભાગ લે.</li>
<li>પળની અંદર સંગ્રતા થી ભાગ લે અને પળને શાશ્વતી બનાવી લે. Live the moment, it will give you sense of eternity.</li>
<li>ઇન્દ્રિયો પારનો રસ્તો ઇન્દ્રિયો માં થઈ ને જાય છે. પરમ નો રસ્તો નગર માં થઈ ને જાય છે. જે માણસ નદી ઓળંગે અને ભીંજાય નહીં એનો કોઈ અર્થ નહીં. હું ભીંજાવ, છોળો ઉછાળતો જાવ..</li>
<li>અસલામતી માં જીવન પાંગરે છે. જીવન ખાતર જુગાર છે. તક મળે તો જુગાર રમી લેવાનો.</li>
<li>જેને શ્રેષ્ઠ જીવવું છે એને શ્રેષ્ઠ દાવ પર પણ મૂકવું પડે છે.</li>
<li>પતન એ ઉત્થાનનો જ ભાગ છે. ભટકવું, ખોવાઈ જવું એ બધું જ.. અંધકાર એ ઉજાસનો જ ભાગ છે.</li>
<li>સ્થૂળ માંથી પસાર થયા વગર સૂક્ષ્મ પમાતુ નથી. જેને દેહનો પ્રેમ નથી કર્યો એ મનના સ્તરે શુ જશે, જે મનના સ્તરે નથી ગયો એ આત્માના સ્તરે શુ જશે.</li>
<li>પૃથ્વીનો સંપર્ક છૂટી જાય એ વૃક્ષ ફળ નથી આપતું. જીવન સાથેનો સંપર્ક અચૂક રાખવો. ચૈતન્યનું લક્ષણ વિસ્તાર છે.</li>
<li>જીવનમાં જે સર્જાય છે.. સંગીત, ચિત્ર, બધાને બે હાથ પહોળા કરીને આવકાર.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tantra-in-day-to-day-life">Tantra in day to day life</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>વધુ ઇન્દ્રિયમય બનો. ઇન્દ્રિયોને ધિક્કારો નહિ. Trust your senses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>મનને પડતું મુકો. આપણને દરેક ક્ષણે મનની જરૂરી નથી. &lsquo;મન મૂકીને ને નાચો&rsquo; When you experience anything with senses live it thoroughly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>અપરાધ ભાવ છોડી દેવાની જરૂર છે. કેટલાક લોકો આંનદ ને જ અપરાધ ગણે છે. દમન ને જવાદો. અપરાધ ભાવ છૂટી જશે તો મનની પકડ ઢીલી થઈ જશે.
leave this : this is good , that is bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જીવનને અભિવ્યક્તિ આપવાની જરૂર છે. મુક્ત રીતે અભિવ્યક્ત કરો. આનંદ જ જીવનનું સાધ્ય, સાધન અને સાધના છે. ત્યાગ વૈરાગ એ પરમ તત્વ નથી. પરમ તત્વ તો રસરાજ છે , રંગ રાજ છે, નટરાજ છે
વિનોબા : એક ઉંમર માં આનંદ પ્રાપ્તિ ધ્યેય હોય છે. પછી આનંદ ની પરિશુધ્ધ ધ્યેય બને. કામ - પ્રેમ - ધ્યાન - પ્રકાશ</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a podcast from Scaler called ScalerPod. Where they interview CTOs from different startups. They ask about their journey, challenges and how their typical day looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Till now I have seen two episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)&#xA;Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to a podcast from Scaler called ScalerPod. Where they interview CTOs from different startups. They ask about their journey, challenges and how their typical day looks like.</p>
<p>Till now I have seen two episodes.</p>
<p>Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)
Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)</p>
<p>I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.</p>
<p>He shared that intrinsic motivation for work comes from three things :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autonomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mastry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connectedness / Purpose</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here you go :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEZMSbeziEw&amp;t=870s">14:30</a> What motivates engineers?</p>
<p><strong>Full episode :</strong></p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEZMSbeziEw?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

      <title>Insights from ASER - Beyond Basics</title>
      <link>https://learningwala.in/blog/insights-from-aser---beyond-basics/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>learningwalamihir@gmail.com (Mihir Pathak)</author>
      <guid>https://learningwala.in/blog/insights-from-aser---beyond-basics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/&#34;&gt;ASER ‘Byond Basics’&lt;/a&gt; report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do they have technology access / smart phone &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are their aspirations &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can they read and do basic maths &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I read the <a href="https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/">ASER ‘Byond Basics’</a> report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do they have technology access / smart phone </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are their aspirations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can they read and do basic maths </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smartphones are a great equlazirer but contentwise we are competing with youtube. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of content we should publish in this situation </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we ask youth what they want?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are you looking at learning happening outside the school ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These all are questions to the window of possibilities. I read the report and some other articles. I am writing some insights which I got reflecting on them. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to have dialgue with youth about what they want </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only creating content and putting it in the air will not work, we need to make the whole ecosystem of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can blame or expect schools to teach everything we need to look at the needs of this age group outside the school structure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to create informal learning spaces where young people can come, talk, and explore freely. (The youth wants a space to share their feelings, anxieties, and fears about the future.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second step can be nudging them for some learning - challenging activities where smartphones or technology can play a bigger role. But that one on one connect, guidance, mentorship is important </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take one scenario : </p>
<p>You started one youth program where young people join and teach children. Through this program you started one ‘youth adda’ where young people can come freely to talk - hangout. </p>
<p>Slowly you made genuine friendship with them, now they are open for your ideas and guidance.</p>
<p>You suggested they do one short course on ‘financial literacy’ so they can manage their finances well. Now high quilty content is important.</p>
<p>Youtube is winning because it is no brainer. You don’t need to think to see insta reels or youtube shots. You need brain, motivation and many other factors to see ‘learning content’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One way is, make your learning content in format of shots and influncere kind of videos. Like Vlogs and more. There are chances that you need to dilute your content to add those types of mirch masala.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second way is to build an ecosystem which encourages and nudges us to explore ‘learning content’ apart from those nobrainers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about Ankur wariku. He is making videos on financial literacy. Apart from making videos he is doing insta live with people to help them to learn ‘how to invest in their given salary’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He is building a community. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is taking subjects which very very relevant to young people </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we need to do both things in balance. We need to make our content more engaging and on the other side we need to build an ecosystem around it. </p>
<p>There are some more insights about vocational training and basic reading and maths </p>
<p>Which I will write some other time. </p>
