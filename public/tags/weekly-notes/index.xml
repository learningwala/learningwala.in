<h4 id="health">Health</h4>
<p>This week was difficult. My mental health is in a very bad phase.
Over the last few months, I somehow managed, but now it’s hitting me hard. I’m not able to concentrate on work.
Feeling anxious, being zoned out, sleep cycle disturbed. I’m feeling that everything is meaningless.
I’ve started therapy. Let’s see how it goes. It’s costly, but at this point in time, I want to invest in my health.
I am very grateful for Nidhi&rsquo;s support.</p>
<p>We bought health supplements for both of us long back, but haven’t started taking them yet.
Yesterday, Nidhi made a nice poster with the timings and names of the supplements.
So… let’s begin!</p>

<p>I want do yoga regularly, wish me luck !!</p>
<p>Nidhi has been unwell for the last few days. Stomach pain — maybe because of outside food in this weather. She’s better today.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="personal-website">Personal Website</h4>
<p>I’ve made some changes to my website hosting setup. I started with a GitHub repo + GitHub Pages, where I edited my files on my local machine, built the Hugo site, and pushed it to the Git repo. It got published on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Cloudflare Pages, where I edited and built the Hugo site and pushed the public folder to CF Pages.</p>
<p>I have different machines at the office and at home. In the CF Pages setup, I wasn’t able to edit my site during my office chai breaks.
Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t want to wait until I sit at my personal laptop to publish them. So I went back to GitHub.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve put all my content files on the Git repo, and CF Pages builds the Hugo site automatically. Now I can edit my files on the Git repo from the browser.
I tried using Git through the command line, but my office laptop is Windows, so it was difficult. It didn’t even understand some file names — some error came because of that.
WSL is not allowed to download, so finally, the browser was my saviour.</p>
<p>I was concerned about the repo size because I publish images in every weekly note.
I’m using Hugo’s image optimization shortcode which converts images into WebP, resizes them, and makes them responsive — so I’m hopeful.</p>
<p>In short, now I can log in to GitHub and edit my site (very basic functions like adding a new post or editing an existing post).</p>
<p>btw I have added small little black dot as favicon :)</p>

<p>Jitu (one of the members from our Sakha community) visited us on Friday. He studies Electronics and Communication at LD Engineering College, Ahmedabad. We talked about AI, programming, life, nature, climate change, and what not… We had nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXKNCSkVweU">Jamnagri Ghughra</a> near our home and took a lovely walk at Eklavya Sports Campus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jamnagari Ghughra is a savory, fried pastry from Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, featuring a spicy potato and pea filling. It&rsquo;s a popular street food, often enjoyed with spicy and sweet chutneys. The dish is known for its crispy outer layer and flavorful stuffing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nidhi made wonderful dhokli today… it reminded me of mom.
(Dhokli is a traditional Gujarati dish — wheat flour dumplings simmered in a tangy, spiced lentil curry. Comfort food at its best.)</p>

<p>We watched <em>Sitare Zameen Par</em> on Monday. It was a nice film. I just wish the narrative had been a little subtler—it felt too direct for me. But still, it&rsquo;s a really important subject that needs to be talked about in mass media.</p>
<p>For the first time, I tried kneading roti dough—with Nidhi’s help. I wasn’t confident at all, but somehow, I managed. I want to explore this more. This week Nidhi made some awesome pasta and experimental bharva taroi sabji :)</p>
<p>On Friday, we facilitated a session on <em>Nature-Based Learning</em> with research and curriculum team at my office. We both enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Saturday evening, we went to Priti Ben’s place. It was rainy, but we enjoyed the metro ride.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we visited a nearby sports campus called <em>Eklavya Sports Academy</em>. It’s a lush green space. We went for a morning walk for the first time. As expected, Nidhi got completely engaged in observing trees and greenery—she was more interested in looking at trees than walking! But still, we managed a nice 3–4 rounds of walking. After that, we went to <em>DVG Benne Dosa</em>. The food was nice but a little pricey. We had ghee masala dosa and palak paddu. We always look for good, authentic South Indian places. After living in Bangalore, we can’t eat dosa at just any regular place. In Gujarat, dosa and sambar are something else altogether. I want to make a list of places in Ahmedabad where you can eat good dosa.</p>
<p>In the evening, we watched a Malayalam film called <em>Hridayam</em>. It was a beautiful film, though it felt a bit long—it runs for 2 hours and 51 minutes.</p>
<p>This week, I also listened to some old Gujarati songs and watched Marathi short film.</p>
<p>This weekend, we had a negotiation around time. Nidhi wanted to spend more time with me, while I wanted some alone time. We somehow figured out a temporary middle path.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I’ve been daydreaming about something strange—I’m dreaming of getting admission into a university. I’ve never been a full-time student at a college or university. I started working when I was 19. Now, I feel this strong craving to live as a student—without tension, experimenting and researching new ideas&hellip; a curiosity-driven life.</p>
<p>I’ve been re-reading the PhD thesis of <a href="https://1derful.org/">Jay Silver</a>(Makey Makey, MIT Media Lab) and wondering if I could also write something about the <em>learning experiments</em> I’ve done with children and teachers over the past 12 years. How my philosophy of education and life has changed. How my understanding of learning has evolved. I want to document and reflect on all my past projects.</p>
<p>Academia scares me with its rigidity, but these days I’m thinking more about independent research—something related to nature education, experiential learning&hellip;is there something like a <em>practicing PhD</em>?</p>
<p>Sometimes, I also feel like doing something entirely different from education. I feel saturated. At times I think I should move into the livelihoods sector or ecological restoration—maybe work with farmers&hellip;</p>
<p>Or maybe I should take a break and just focus on writing, doing theater, learning music, studying design, aesthetics and philosophy —something for the soul. Not for money. Not to prove anything.</p>
<p>My relationship with money is also changing radically. Now, I spend without overthinking. I don’t ask whether something is expensive—I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it useful?</li>
<li>Is it solving a real problem?</li>
<li>Is it sustainably made?</li>
<li>Is it an impulsive buy, or something I truly need?</li>
<li>Even if it’s impulsive, is it eco-friendly or socially just?</li>
<li>Do I want to support this kind of business?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if I’m buying a pair of chappals made from sustainable materials, designed well, and if the brand promotes justice—and if I can afford it—I won’t obsess over the cost. I mean, I won’t judge it <em>only</em> by the price.</p>
<p>Even with all this reflection, I’m still in a grey zone. I’m not very clear about my relationship with money right now. From childhood, we’re taught to save, to not spend much on things or experiences. But once you start earning, once you live in a city, your relationship with money shifts.</p>
<p>What if I want to eat 200 benne dosas in Ahmedabad? I’ll buy them. Food should be good. Living spaces should be good. Spend money on books, travel, meeting people, hosting friends, sending gifts&hellip; doing experiments&hellip; everything that nourishes your soul.</p>
<p>My mental health hasn’t been great. I’ll seek help soon.
My back pain has returned—possibly due to driving and sitting too much. I need to start exercising again and using a hot bag.</p>

<p>This week was not very hectic, but not too slow either. Overall, it was a good week, work-wise.
On Monday and Tuesday, we spent time with the Nature Classroom team.</p>
<p>Nidhi visited Mumbai to facilitate a workshop. She felt very confident while facilitating the session and really enjoyed it. I felt so happy seeing her journey as a facilitator/educator. I’m so grateful to be a small part of her journey, and that she is part of mine.</p>
<p>On Saturday and Sunday, I spent time finishing small tasks that had been pending for a long time—giving feedback, replying to emails, and more.</p>
<p>I enjoyed working on my desk</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I had a call with two of my friends to discuss their learning pathways and career paths. In the development sector—especially when you&rsquo;re working with an NGO in the education space—your growth is not always predictable or linear. It’s not like the corporate world, where you get promotions at regular intervals.
What if you want to remain an educator, continue working directly with children, and still grow in other aspects of life—money, new skills, new kinds of learning, or new types of projects?
What if you don’t see “Project Manager” as your next goal?
What should a growth pathway look like that gives you enough challenges to stay inspired, helps you feel meaning in your work, and shifts as you move through different life phases?</p>
<p>I have developed a questionnaire for personal reflection. Whenever I consider changing my job / taking new project, I ask myself these questions. This time, I shared them with friends who are also looking for clarity and new ideas. Let’s see if it helps. Let me know if you’re interested in a framework to think about your next move—I’d be happy to share it. We can even have a one-on-one call to brainstorm and explore together.</p>
<p>This framework includes reflecting on your personal philosophy / values, strengths, interests, learning aspirations, financial needs, and cultural/social/emotional needs. It&rsquo;s also useful for documenting your past work and building your portfolio.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing some thoughts on self-directed learning and portfolio-making with the <em>Sanjhe Sapne</em> team. We&rsquo;re having weekly learning calls, and I’m enjoying them so much.</p>
<p>I’m also working with the YouCAN – Earth Educator Fellows, sharing my insights about working with children and developing programs. I’m learning a lot from each one of them. As an alum of this fellowship, I feel very grateful for the opportunity to stay connected with like-minded and like-hearted people.</p>
<p>A big part of my work revolves around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing tools and creating environments for self-directed learning</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel the need to start documenting my frameworks and ideas—maybe that will be the topic for my next blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="sakha-fellowship-updates-">Sakha Fellowship Updates :</h4>
<p>Sakhaz are working on two projects. One is an inquiry project around rural/village issues. They’ve prepared a survey form and visited a village near Waghodia. The second project is about interviewing unsung heroes. They started by interviewing a 100-year-old <em>masi</em> who runs a <em>sev-usal</em> shop in Vadodara.</p>
<p>We both feel so happy seeing the updates, but unfortunately, we haven’t been able to engage with the Sakhaz in person. We only get Saturdays and Sundays off — and those are usually packed with our other project meetings, home maintenance work, and a bit of downtime. That’s also when the Sakha team meets in Vadodara.</p>
<p>Technically, Vadodara is just 3 hours away, but it takes us 1 hour just to get to a place from where we can catch a bus. We’d need to leave work early on Friday evening, and we don’t have a place to stay in Vadodara either. So, all of this makes it really difficult… but we’ll find a way to join in somehow.</p>
<p>We really miss the energy and connection with the Sakhaz.</p>
<hr>
<p>The rest of the week was mostly filled with office work.
This week was also filled with some existential questions—
Is my work worth doing?
Am I on the right path?
What is my relationship with money, and with my employer?</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I feel like I’m in a phase of life where my ambitions to “make it big” or “be successful” in the conventional sense are getting quieter. I’m okay with slow and small now.
What’s calling me more is building meaningful relationships—with peers, friends, partner, family, the larger ecosystem and support system. I want to invest in that, rather than chasing individual success. Supporting friends in finding their paths, doing projects together, sharing ideas, contacts, networks, resources—without guarding them. Meeting people without agendas. Just being grateful and feeling enough—for who I am and who others are.</p>
<p>I’m slowly becoming less aggressive about pushing my own ideas—trying to learn the art of listening, of understanding other perspectives.</p>
<p>Over the last few months—conflicts at home, changing dynamics at work, and the deepening of my relationship with my partner—have all changed me.
Maybe it’s just age.I have turned 30 this May.</p>
<p>I was also feeling anxious during parts of this week because of some work tasks, but somehow I managed. Writing and journaling help—they slow down my thoughts and help me feel calm.</p>
<p>I’m considering therapy to work on my overall mental health, which has been affected by multiple things over the past few months.</p>
<p>Anyway… it was a good week.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I watched an old Marathi web series and listened to some beautiful, slow Hindi and Marathi songs.</p>

<p><strong>Rain has started in Ahmedabad:</strong></p>

<p><strong>I remembered this beautiful poem by my dear friend Hemant Deolekar:</strong></p>
<p><strong>पेड़ों का अंतर्मन</strong></p>
<p><em>हेमंत देवलेकर</em></p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>कल मानसून की पहली बरसात हुई</p>
<p>और आज यह दरवाज़ा ख़ुशी से फूल गया है</p>
<p>खिड़की दरवाज़े महज़ लकड़ी नहीं हैं विस्थापित जंगल होते हैं</p>
<p>मुझे लगा, मैं पेड़ों के बीच से आता-जाता हूँ</p>
<p>टहनियों पर बैठता हूँ</p>
<p>पेड़ों की खोखल में रहती हैं किताबें</p>
<p>मैं, जंगल में घिरा हूँ</p>
<p>किंवदंतियों में रहने वाला</p>
<p>आदिम ख़ुशबू से भरा जंगल</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>कल मौसम की पहली बारिश हुई</p>
<p>और आज यह दरवाज़ा</p>
<p>चौखट में फँसने लगा है</p>
<p>वह बंद होना नहीं चाहता</p>
<p>ठीक दरख़्तों की तरह</p>
<p>एक कटे हुए जिस्म में</p>
<p>पेड़ का ख़ून फिर दौड़ने लगा है</p>
<p>और यह दरवाज़ा बचपन की स्मृतियों में खो गया है</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>याद आने लगा है</p>
<p>किस तरह वह बाँहें फैलाकर</p>
<p>हज़ारों हथेलियों में समेटा करता था</p>
<p>बारिश को</p>
<p>और झूमने लगता था</p>
<p>वह स्मृतियों में फिर हरा हुआ है।</p>

<p>This will be a short note. Nothing much happened this week.</p>
<p>We celebrated International Play Day at the office, and it was super fun! The office team asked our relatives for our childhood photos and made a beautiful collage. It was really, really enjoyable to recognize each other from childhood photographs. We played games and shared our childhood memories.</p>
<p>One of our close friends came to spend time with us at our place. I feel very wholesome when someone comes to spend time with us without any specific agenda—cooking together, eating together, talking, sharing ideas, taking a walk together. That gives me warmth and makes me feel loved.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m realizing that spending time with friends, family, and loved ones is what&rsquo;s truly interesting. I should do it more. One part of myself always leans towards interesting projects, but now I want to consciously choose the projects and people I work with, as well as my working patterns. I want to invest my time and energy in spending time and having interesting experiences with loved ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering why people aspire for job stability or working long-term in one organization. It&rsquo;s because it gives you security and belonging—you get time and mental space to think about other things in life. When you stay at one organization and remain in one place (city or town), you make connections with that city. It would be wonderful to have friends nearby. Living close to your dear friends is a bliss.</p>
<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t feel connected to Ahmedabad. I felt connected to Vadodara, Bhuj, and Bangalore. I need to make more effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling very grateful to the universe. We&rsquo;re both getting very nice work opportunities. I&rsquo;m working with organizations and projects, directly or indirectly, that I&rsquo;m really aligned with. Sometimes it&rsquo;s overwhelming to work on too many projects, and I get anxiety, but it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m learning to manage it.</p>
<p>We started an online yoga class, but it&rsquo;s not working well. In a week, we only did it for two days. It&rsquo;s not a live class—they&rsquo;re doing YouTube live with interactive chat. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I wish to start some legitimate sports activity like cycling, swimming, or running.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now regular with breakfast, making very simple things like ragi malt with milk and dry fruits, or oats.</p>
<p>I bought Kesar mangoes from our office&rsquo;s mango orchard. They are so yummy! We made aam ras and loved it.</p>
<h2 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monday and Tuesday: The nature classroom team is coming to visit the learning center. They are developing a nature education assessment framework. During this visit, they will test some of their work with children.</li>
<li>Nidhi is going to conduct nature education sessions with teachers in Mumbai next week.</li>
<li>The Sakha group is doing a geo inquiry project. We had an initial meeting.</li>
<li>We had a meeting with a friend who is helping us write articles about our past projects like the Time Exhibition, Viswamitri River Project, &ldquo;How About Seeing Bangalore,&rdquo; and more.</li>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to combine two weekly notes, but there&rsquo;s no option now—it&rsquo;s too late. The last two weeks were super happening, but I&rsquo;ll keep it short here. Sunday is almost gone and too many work tasks are pending.</p>
<p>Let me start with this: I miss BLR. Weather, food, people—everything&hellip; I follow specific people on Twitter just to take in Bangalore vibes.</p>
<p>26th &amp; 27th went into office work. We took a flight from Ahmedabad to Bangalore on the 28th morning, reached there by afternoon. Met Thejesh for the first time. It was nice to have a chat with him about life, work, food, and other stuff. When you read a person&rsquo;s weekly notes, you feel you already know them.</p>

<p>We visited a friend&rsquo;s place in HSR, freshened up, met another dear friend Jubin, had dinner, and caught the bus for Coonoor. Reached early morning.</p>
<p>We were unprepared for Coonoor&rsquo;s weather (no sweater, no proper footwear for the rocky terrain). We borrowed a sweater from someone and somehow managed.</p>
<p>Spent 5 days with amazing nature educators who came from all over India &amp; the YouCAN team. It was a mix of feelings—it gave me a sense of belonging to the community that I am an alumni of this fellowship. In some moments it gave me self-doubt, and in other moments it gave me profound inspiration.</p>

<p>We met dear friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theearthlynotes/">Adithi Muralidhar</a> at Coonoor. I did my internship under her at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education - Design &amp; Technology Education lab, Mumbai.</p>
<p>While coming back, we again halted in BLR, met Ruchir, the Nature Classrooms team, and folks from Nature Conservation Foundation. Visiting Nature Classroom&rsquo;s office, meeting the all-girls team, and seeing their amazing work gives me happiness, hope, and inspiration. Someday I want to build a space/org like this in my native place.</p>

<p>3rd June - we&rsquo;re back in town—Ahmedabad.
4th I did work from home. 5th I went to the office.</p>
<p>I got sick on the 6th. Suddenly got fever and loose motions&hellip; it was food poisoning. Still recovering. I don&rsquo;t know how I got it—maybe because of traveling or outside food or heat, don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m thankful that it&rsquo;s not covid. I&rsquo;m feeling better now.</p>
<p>No reading during the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Music : We sang nice songs during the campfire at the fellowship residency. That night is memorable.</p>
<p>Overall mood is happy but a little stressed because of too many pending tasks at the office and also from other side projects.</p>
<p>Sakha fellowship work is going well. Ashish bhai and Rameshwari ben are leading it very well. Today me and Nidhi attended one team meeting, and we got some new updates.</p>
<p>Sakhas are taking up new projects. One of the groups wants to start a podcast for unsung heroes from daily life, one group wants to visit villages and explore the issues over there. Me and Nidhi are thinking to meet them and help them convert their project into a <a href="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/file/Educator_Guide_Geo_Inquiry_Final_2.pdf">geo inquiry project</a>. Anyone interested in developing and documenting geo inquiry projects with children, please let me know. Happy to collaborate. We&rsquo;re also planning to host sessions on financial literacy, gender, and youth-life-related stuff. No motivation or gyan. Real problems of youth and exploration for the same.</p>
<p>Otherwise, everything is going well. I need to catch up with a few friends and do proper planning for the side projects.</p>

<p>Dear friend Siddhartha helped us make the final logo of KBM. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple and cute logo. Chappal is part of the logo because our central idea is exploration and inquiry, and what&rsquo;s a better medium to do exploration than &lsquo;walk&rsquo;!! So the chappal (footwear) :)</p>
<p>We also launched our Instagram handle on 5th June—World Environment Day. Check it out here.</p>

<p>This week started by losing my Pilot pen. Let me tell you, I really, really love my Pilot V7/V5 pens. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I lost it—I used to lose it when I worked in schools. I generally use my Pilot pen to make notes in notebooks. I love the smoothness of the writing experience that comes with liquid ink. The V7 has a refill cartridge. I have Hi-Tech Point Pen ink, which I put into the cartridge and use the pen again. This can be done 3 to 4 times. After that, ink overflows from the joint near the nib.</p>
<p>I prefer black ink over blue or other colors. I also have other ink pens for which I use Sulekha Swadeshi green ink.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, Nidhi found the lost pen in one of my shirt pockets.</p>
<hr>
<p>I finally cleaned my laptop&rsquo;s fan. I ordered a screwdriver from Blinkit, watched a video on YouTube, and opened the back cover of my super light ThinkPad Carbon. I observed that there was no heat sink paste remaining on the processor, so I decided to buy paste from Amazon and apply it myself.</p>
<p>It was around ₹500 to ₹1000. I searched for local shops and asked for rates. Finally, a very nearby shop did it for ₹300.</p>

<p>Nidhi made thali pith. We wanted to make something tasty and fast. A friend suggested this, and Nidhi made it nicely on her first attempt. She was super happy.</p>

<hr>
<p>I had an online learning circle call with the Sanjhe Sapne team. We&rsquo;re going to have this call every month. I&rsquo;ll share more about it some other time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Office colleagues came home on Wednesday evening. We had homemade cold coffee and lots of talking. We want to host friends and serve healthy drinks like ragi malt, hibiscus tea, aam panna, and sattu.</p>
<p>Nidhi made idli sambar. Now we feel at ease making idli sambar. We still need to buy a cast iron tava for dosa. Any good recommendations?</p>
<hr>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s friend from Azim Premji University came to our home. We both feel very happy when someone comes to our place just to stay without any agenda, to spend quality time. It&rsquo;s a privilege to get time to go to your friend&rsquo;s place and just stay.</p>

<p>Weekend traveling was hectic. We took an AC Volvo bus. It was super expensive—a normal bus is ₹100 and Volvo is around ₹320—but it was helpful in this heat and with back pain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates</h2>
<p>I had a call with Adhvan about developing a map module. I want to develop activities where children can connect to their own place—town—city. Knowing local plants, trees, vendors, systems, being part of citizenship activities, heritage, conservation, using senses, walking.</p>
<p>Something like: Re-imagining Maps - Explore the science and art of cartography through conversations about maps and interactive mapmaking. This is an invitation to renegotiate how we interact with landscapes, how we understand maps, and how we document the spaces we occupy and the lives we live within them.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends shared an address of a famous Hindi author, which comes with a footnote after the main address:</p>
<p>🌱 (कटोरा तालाब मुख्य मार्ग में बूढ़ी मां मंदिर तक आना होगा। मंदिर के सामने मुख्यमार्ग में माँ शारदा होम्योपैथी दुकान के बाजू की सड़क पर अंदर आखिरी घर है।)</p>
<p>🌳 अंदर आने वाली सड़कों पर बोर्ड लगे हैं। जिस बोर्ड में कटोरा तालाब सड़क नंबर 11 लिखा है, उसी सड़क पर अंदर आना होगा। दाहिने ओर का सबसे आखिरी घर है।</p>
<p>घर के अंदर एक आम का पेड़, घर के बाहर एक ओर मौलश्री के दो पेड़ और दूसरी ओर सप्तपर्णी, मौलश्री, करंज के पेड़ भी रहते हैं। साथ में गिलहरियां, चिड़ियां और हम सब भी।</p>
<p>Are we connected to our place apart from Google Map locations? What Google Maps shows are commercially active places like malls, petrol pumps, shops—not trees, small shops, small landmarks, small water bodies. Anything that&rsquo;s not generating money is not on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Can we design our own maps? Can we use maps as a tool to connect with ourselves and the places we live in? Can this become an activity module?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super interested in this project. Let me know if you want to collaborate in any capacity.</p>
<p>Another project I want to work on is &lsquo;fostering wonder and awe&rsquo; in children&rsquo;s lives, very much inspired by the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacher_Keltner">Dacher Keltner</a>. I want to work with children from 3 to 11 years of age.</p>
<p>Read: <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2024.1229029">Wonder-Full Hearts: Awe Turns Children into Caring Champions</a></p>
<p>I actually struggle to keep these two personalities—one which is very playful, curious, and storytelling while working with little children, and suddenly shifting to social justice, connecting with place, and citizenship ideas while working with older children or educators. I keep shifting between these. But ultimately everything is the same&hellip; be playful, curious, walk slowly, and wonder more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="social-media-usage">Social Media Usage</h2>
<p>I consume Instagram, which shows me mostly artists, photographers, writers, and nature lover profiles and posts. Posting on Instagram is getting less frequent. I want to put selected weekly note photos on social media regularly, but it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>I consume LinkedIn, which shows me mostly people and posts from the development sector. I&rsquo;m literally fed up with that.</p>
<p>Twitter shows me mostly developers and entrepreneurs from Bangalore.</p>
<p>Apart from all of this, I really enjoy reading weekly notes from different people. I use a feed reader to track and read weekly notes from selected people.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall mood is happy.</p>
<p>My reading is paused again. I&rsquo;ll try to resume it in June.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="12th-may-to-18th-may-2025-monday-to-sunday">12th May to 18th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>This week was Happy Week. I tried enjoying each and every day as it came.
Not getting time to write my weekly note on Sunday and finishing it on Monday is getting difficult. I want to write in detail but I&rsquo;m not getting the mental space.</p>
<p>I got a new laptop from the office - a ThinkPad E16.
It is heavy, runs Windows, has a big screen,
and battery backup is good.</p>
<p>The first few days I was not ready to leave my Carbon and shift to this because of my set workflow. But according to office policy, I needed to, so finally I moved.</p>
<p>My Carbon is giving me little problems nowadays. The venting system in X series is not that great. In Ahmedabad&rsquo;s heat, the fan of my machine is going mad. On the other side, the E16 is working smoothly.</p>
<p>I asked a few friends - they said there must be dust in the fan which needs to be cleaned, and I should avoid tasks with high CPU usage. I will clean it and see.</p>
<hr>
<p>From Monday to Wednesday, we had a storytelling workshop by Vikram Sridhar at our office.
On Tuesday, we went to The Calico Museum of Textiles as part of the workshop.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad is called a &lsquo;World Heritage City&rsquo; and it has 30+ museums. I never saw this city through a heritage lens.But now both Nidhi and I have decided to see this city through this lens. We want to start by going on heritage walks, visiting museums, and being part of the theater culture here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tuesday we watched a film called &lsquo;Bangalore Days.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a nice, fun film in Malayalam. We watched it with subtitles. Nidhi recommended this film; she watched it a few years ago and she really liked it.</p>
<p>We also finished the film &lsquo;Angoor,&rsquo; which we had started watching earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summer break at school, so our canteen is closed. That means I need to prepare food at home and take a lunch box. For me, waking up early and making food is difficult. Same with Nidhi. I can do reading, writing, and other kinds of work in the morning, but not cooking. Nidhi is helping so much with cooking lunch and breakfast. Slowly, I have also started making breakfast. So now in the morning, we both are stretching ourselves and preparing food.</p>
<p>Nidhi is also experimenting with dinner and snacks. She loves cooking and experimenting with food. She&rsquo;s basically a foodie. I am cognitively very interested in food but slowly getting interested in the hands-on part of it - I mean cooking. For me, it&rsquo;s a long way to go. I know basic cooking like making khichadi, sabji, dal-chawal&hellip; I need to learn roti. Most importantly, I need to learn how to use the kitchen neatly.</p>
<p>Apart from this, we both want to constantly work on our diet because of our sensitive stomachs. Especially my stomach, which is very sensitive. The doctor told me that it&rsquo;s like the stomach of a 6-year-old. So we both need to remind ourselves to eat at home and eat millets, fruits,things with less masala.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday, we started watching a web series called &lsquo;Very Parivarik&rsquo; by TVF. It is a very relatable show.</p>
<p>On the same day, we had a long conversation about spending quality time with each other. For both of us, quality time means different things. Example : For Nidhi, it&rsquo;s cooking together, and for me, it&rsquo;s discussing ideas/brainstorming together. So we made a list of things and shared with each other. We also made a kind of timetable to fit everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>We went to Aarambh Cafe on Saturday evening. I was craving good sambar. Actually, Kamla Cafe, Aarambh Cafe, Kasturba Cafe, Atithi Restaurant, and Thepla Sabji from Gajanand - these are places that serve food which we can eat without worrying about our stomachs.</p>

<p><strong>We discussed Khojbeen Mandali activities. Some updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of our friends from Eklavya Foundation, Melody, wrote an article on &lsquo;Development of Aesthetic Sense in Primary Grades Through Nature-Based Activities&rsquo; which got published in a journal by Azim Premji University. I was part of this project, creating activities and mentoring the facilitator. Now we are planning to publish this work in other magazines like Sandarbh, Vikalp Sangam, and Nature Classrooms blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Nature Classrooms book &lsquo;There Is Nothing There,&rsquo; which Nidhi translated into Hindi, we are collaborating with Eklavya Foundation to print it in Hindi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are inviting Tanaya from Nature Classrooms to come to Ahmedabad. She will be observing pilots about nature education assessment tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are conducting a local Khoji film-making camp this coming weekend (23rd to 25th May)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tried developing a logo and visual identity for Khojbeen Mandali with a few friends. We gained some clarity about what we want during the process. We&rsquo;re going with what I made initially. One more friend is helping to make it better. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll get something interesting in the next few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coonoor trip for Earth Educator Workshop. (28th May to 3rd June 2025)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Sunday we went to Vikram Sridhar&rsquo;s storytelling performance at Scrap Yard. We enjoyed driving the Activa at night on surprisingly less trafficked roads.</p>
<p>I spent time coordinating with the team for the local Khoji camp.</p>
<p>I started reading again but am not getting uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="5th-may-to-11th-may-2025-monday-to-sunday">5th May to 11th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>It was my birthday week. I never celebrated birthdays explicitly in my childhood or even in my adulthood - no cake cutting, no party. In school, May 9th was mostly vacation time. In adulthood, I worked in schools, so again I had vacation during that time. At home, mom used to make my favorite food &lsquo;vedhmi&rsquo; / puran poli. I never got a chance to celebrate my birthday with friends. I remember celebrating once with my Eklavya office colleagues, friends, and participants.</p>
<p>But this time was different. Nidhi and friends made it super special.</p>
<p>Apart from that, this week was full of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness because of the political situation in the country and the situation at my home. I messaged my friends in Bhuj to check on them during blackout days. Got news about the ceasefire and very soon after, the breaking of that ceasefire.</p>
<p>At home, also ceasefire happened; we involved some other family members too. Mom went to Padra on Sunday. Let&rsquo;s see how long this ceasefire lasts&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> was a regular office day. There was a storm in the evening. It was raining at night. Nidhi made wonderful cold coffee in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> I worked from home. My stomach was not well.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> I also worked from home because of rain. We went to Teapost, Sindhu Bhavan Road in the evening.</p>
<p>We received the <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/2025/05/07/nagarathna-memorial-grant-2025-results/">Nagarathna Memorial Grant</a>. We will use the grant money for the local khoji camp coming up at the end of May.</p>
<p><strong>On Thursday</strong>, we set up paintings. Now this home feels like home.</p>

<p><strong>On Friday</strong> - my birthday! :)

<p>Buying plants and setting up composting is still pending.</p>
<p>Me, Bansi, and Nidhi went to Kamla Cafe for dinner and walked back home.
We had a chat about life until late night.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>We started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215517/">Angoor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Nidhi and I read a small book about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenu_Kuruba">Jenu Kuruba Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The Jenu Kuruba are a tribal group from the Nilgiris, numbering around 37,000.They are concentrated in the districts bordering the states of Kerala and Karnataka.
&lsquo;Jenu&rsquo; means &lsquo;honey&rsquo; in Kannada, referring to their traditional occupation as collectors of honey in the forest.</p>

<p>This week went by incredibly fast. There were many meetings at the office, and work is really gearing up. I didn&rsquo;t get time to explore anything beyond work.</p>
<p>This week, Nidhi did many cooking experiments. She loves cooking and experimenting with food. She made the following dishes throughout the week:</p>

<p>I forgot to take photo of Bhindi kadhi</p>
<p>On Sunday, we made idli sambar. I tried my hand at making sambar following Nidhi&rsquo;s instructions. It turned out nice for a first attempt.</p>
<p>We went grocery shopping at a superstore. We reflected on how we&rsquo;re becoming disconnected from local kirana stores and small businesses. We&rsquo;ve started referring to malls and superstores as &ldquo;Maya Bazaar.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re going to try finding ways to purchase more items from kirana stores—less superstore shopping, less Blinkit ordering, and less Instagram-influenced purchasing.</p>
<p>Nidhi did some trial English-to-Hindi translation work for NCF outreach. If selected, she&rsquo;ll be doing translations related to nature and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Setting up our composting system and buying plants are still pending. Time seems to rush from one task to another, leaving me feeling neither rested nor free from the tension of uncompleted tasks.</p>
<p>It was enjoyable having lunch and dinner together on Saturday and Sunday. We often feel the urge to watch something while eating. We&rsquo;ve started watching old shows like &ldquo;Vikram Vetal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Byomkesh Bakshi.&rdquo; We try to select shows that Mom can also enjoy.</p>
<p>We watched the Gujarati film &ldquo;Reva.&rdquo; Though Nidhi and I had seen it before, we watched it again with Mom.</p>
<p>Nidhi is collecting seeds from the fruits we&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>I started taking ragi malt for breakfast and am loving it.</p>
<p>Mom is okay. Things are on hold. Let&rsquo;s see what happens next.</p>
<p>We want to launch an Instagram page for our nature education/experiential learning initiative. We&rsquo;ve named it &lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali,&rsquo; embodying the spirit of curiosity, wonder, and inquiry. A bunch of friends are helping us create a logo and Instagram templates. I could have started with the basic elements I already have, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying the process of crafting an identity and translating ideas into visuals. This has been the highlight of my week, along with, of course, the delicious food prepared by Nidhi and Mom. I&rsquo;m very grateful to them.</p>
<p>We are going to Coonoor for a workshop at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve booked our tickets. We&rsquo;re also planning to spend one day in Bangalore to meet friends. We are very excited about this trip.</p>
<p>This week involved no reading apart from office work, and no music either. I need to get back to reading.</p>
<p>Overall mood : I am ok, not in much stress. I am trying to keep my self calm and happy.</p>

<p>This week was again a roller coaster ride. Too much is happening. I am not getting the mindspace to write this weekly note in detail, so I am just putting down pointers.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal office day. After a long weekend, all teammates gathered and had a nice catch-up.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took leave. Nidhi and I went to Vadodara. Mom came back with us. The home situation is not well.</p>
<p>We had a clay workshop in the office. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions with children at the learning center are on pause because of summer vacation. They will resume in June. Nowadays, she is working on developing project-based nature education modules for grades 6 to 9.</p>
<p>Mummy was sharing about having difficulty in reading. Nidhi and Mummy went to Lenskart and got a new pair of glasses. Lenskart made the whole eye test and spectacle buying experience very smooth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.earthfocus.in/">Earth Focus</a> team sent a copy of &lsquo;Stop, Look and Wonder,&rsquo; their nature education curriculum. I had the opportunity to review the curriculum while they were developing it last year.</p>

<p>I shared learning resources on the following topics through blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/childhoodinindia/">Childhood in India</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/play/">Education and Play</a></li>
<li><a href="/blog/reflectivewriting/">Reflective Writing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I watched this podcast again to get inspired by the wonderful work they are doing:</p>

    </div>

<p>The Papon concert got canceled due to the Kashmir incident. Both the artist and organizer decided to cancel it, and we got a full refund. It was going to be our first concert experience.</p>
<p>We bought a big plastic drum to start our composting journey. We still need to get soil.</p>
<p>At the office, we hosted a nature education session with children. Nidhi also joined for it. I am so glad and grateful that she could come. She is always a big support and inspiration for me. I am very grateful to my office team also for initiating and being part of it.</p>

<p>I played &lsquo;Cards Against Humanity&rsquo; for the first time. It was horrible! :) But I enjoyed games that are language-heavy, where you need to make jokes, play with vocabulary, and talk in metaphors. I will write in detail about this in another post.</p>

<p>Finally, we bought a 70L cooler from Vijay Sales. We wanted to buy from a local manufacturer/non-branded cooler because it&rsquo;s cheaper, but we couldn&rsquo;t find any shops selling them. So finally, we went to Croma but didn&rsquo;t get good rates. Eventually, we bought it from Vijay Sales.</p>
<p>We have two bedrooms, and we tried setting up the cooler so both rooms get some cool air, allowing us to avoid using the AC. It worked, but we need to keep doors open all night. We&rsquo;re thinking about buying one more small cooler or using the AC in the bedroom&hellip; let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is we didn&rsquo;t get a pipe and noseal in nearby shops. We went to a nearby mall (Mr. DIY), but the pipe was very expensive there. Finally, we found an option on Blinkit that we need to order. I continuously feel that we&rsquo;re getting disconnected from the local ecosystem because of this apartment lifestyle.</p>
<p>Saturday, Nidhi, Mom, and I went to Kamla Cafe for dinner.</p>
<p>Sunday, we had a call with our financial advisor to understand health insurance. It was very interesting to learn how it works. The process to claim insurance is getting stricter because of the many frauds happening in the country. We also had a short discussion about registering our own trust / NGO to facilitate our work with children. Two three already suggested the same thing but we are still thinking about the idea.</p>
<p>I had a call about storytelling and setting up a library space with a teacher working in Kendriya Vidyalaya. She is doing storytelling with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankittellsstories/?originalSubdomain=in">Ankit from TISS Mumbai</a>.</p>
<p>The home situation is getting worse. I am in constant stress and anxiety. Let&rsquo;s hope things get better in the coming week.</p>

<p>My weekly note cycle got affected because of travel. I published my last note on the 16th. I could have published a combined note for weeks 15 &amp; 16, but I didn’t want to miss anything while combining them. Combining two weeks felt like a ‘very long time’, and I wanted to be there with my fellow weekly note-writers… so here I am with weekly note 16/2025.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I went to the office after a week-long break. There were very few people from our team because of the long weekend.</p>
<p>My back pain returned. I was standing and tried to pick up something from the floor when it hurt terribly. I just got to the fridge, and Nidhi helped me with an ice pack. It worked.</p>
<p>On Friday, we spent time decorating our home with small items we have, like fridge magnets and some toys. The paintings are still waiting to be framed.</p>

<p>Nidhi made a bandhanwar.</p>
<p>Our Activa wasn’t starting. We tried repeatedly and finally went to a nearby garage. The mechanic put in a new battery, serviced the brakes, and changed the engine oil. Now it’s running very smoothly.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went to CEE. We visited a new shop called InStore and tried to visit CEE’s nature shop, but it was closed. We went to Aarambh Cafe and had hibiscus tea, dosa, and uttapam.</p>

<p>I like the sambar from this place. The hibiscus tea was costly but we enjoyed it. We ate out a lot last week, so we decided to work on getting back into our cooking rhythm.</p>
<p>InStore’s curation was super cool; I really liked their collection of origami lamps, ceramic wind chimes, and other items. I was amazed at how “eco-friendly,” “organic,” and “sustainable life” products have been commercialized. Nidhi mentioned after seeing the products that we could make these at home. But do we have the time? Do we have the skills? And again, do we have time to invest in developing these skills?</p>
<p>On Saturday, we conducted a natural color-making workshop with children at the Tatvic office. Nidhi led the session. It was fun!</p>

<p>I cleaned my laptop with isopropyl alcohol. It looks nice now, and I enjoy working on it more.</p>
<p>We went out to find materials for Sunday’s workshop. We wanted plastic straws for making “toys from trash” (Arvind Gupta toys). Surprisingly, we didn’t find plastic straws in stationery shops, Mr. DIY, or shops selling disposable items. Everyone is selling steel or paper straws. We couldn’t find plastic straws at all, which was interesting! Anyway, we only checked around the Thaltej area, so geography matters.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we conducted another workshop on “Fun with Science”/toys from trash with children at the Tatvic office. We made a balloon rocket, which didn’t work for some reason. We did two more interesting experiments that amazed the children. They shared lots of ideas about how those particular things work. I’ll try to write a detailed post about this.</p>

<p>We ordered a helmet from Amazon—a Vega Atom. It’s a nice, compact, lightweight helmet. I like it. Now I can drive more confidently.</p>
<p>we are now using AC on daily basis. We are getting habitual, which we don’t want for multiple reasons.. environment, money, health.. we are thinking to buy small cooler.</p>
<p>The situation at home is bad again. I get anxious whenever someone calls me from there. I really don’t know how to handle this. I feel helpless. Last week everything was ok, suddenly things changed.</p>

<p>My reading paused during the Bhopal visit. This week I read a few pages from the book “Mane Fom Chhe.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-april-to-16th-april-2025-monday-to-wed">7th April to 16th April 2025 (Monday to Wed)</h4>
<p>This time I am a little delayed in writing my weekly note. This week was super busy.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal work day at the office.</p>
<p>I made a very basic version of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voicesofvishwamitri/?hl=en">VoV</a> website on WordPress. I need help in curating content and page design ideas. I&rsquo;m not getting enough time to work on it.</p>
<p>Tuesday &amp; Wednesday we had a &lsquo;storytelling workshop&rsquo; at the office by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_storytellingfellow/?hl=en">Vikram Sridhar</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, we left for Bhopal. Nidhi got a confirmed ticket because of tatkal booking, and I got an RAC ticket (I booked it a few days ago). Finally, we slept on Nidhi&rsquo;s seat and gave the other seat to the RAC fellow. It was a tiring journey.</p>
<p>Eklavya is our second home. Whenever we go there, we meet our close friends and colleagues. This place is super welcoming - welcoming you, your ideas; it&rsquo;s not just a workplace but a family for nomads like us. We share everything with each other, from personal life to work life.</p>
<p>This visit was special because we were visiting Eklavya for the first time after our wedding. We got lots of gifts &amp; hugs from our friends there. I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>Almost every day we went out to eat with friends, which was the best part of the trip.</p>
<p>Thursday: During my last visit, I tried <a href="https://myfoodstory.com/burmese-khow-suey-recipe/">veg khow suey</a> at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amerbakeryhut.bhopal/?hl=en">Amer Bakery, Bitten Market</a>. This time also we went there with friends and had it. I loved it.</p>

<p><strong>Khavsa: Gujarat connection of Khow Suey</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://curlytales.com/surats-khavsa-is-the-distant-cousin-of-burmas-khow-suey-know-about-its-interesting-history/">Khavsa</a>, a popular Gujarati street food, traces its roots back to Burma (Myanmar), where it is known as Khow Suey. The dish&rsquo;s journey to Gujarat is linked to the Memon community, who had strong trading ties with Myanmar. They adapted the Burmese Khow Suey to Gujarati tastes, resulting in the spicy, textured Khavsa we know today.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bought new footwear from Bata. It was long overdue. I didn&rsquo;t think much - went into the showroom with the idea to buy sandals but came out with Bata Quovadis chappals. They look like Birkenstock, but the build quality is very different. Overall, I liked them. They&rsquo;re very comfy and go well with my overall look, which is mostly cotton shirts with cotton cargo pants.</p>

<p>Friday: We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/icecreamfactoryindia/?hl=en">Shahi Durbar</a> and had wonderful mango &amp; guava ice cream. Had dinner at <a href="https://www.indiancoffeehouse.com/">The Indian Coffee House</a>. I&rsquo;m always fascinated to learn about the history and co-operative model of ICH. This time I learned more about its history from a friend and also read something on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Indian Coffee House chain has a significant historical connection to leftist movements, particularly the Indian Communist Party. During the 1950s, the Coffee Board&rsquo;s decision to shut down the chain sparked a workers&rsquo; revolt led by communist leader A.K. Gopalan, which ultimately led to the coffee houses being handed over to worker cooperatives. This event solidified the coffee house&rsquo;s identity as a space for left-leaning political activity and discussion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I realize why ICH isn&rsquo;t present in Gujarat!</p>
<p>Saturday: We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theten.in/?hl=en">The10</a> with all friends from the &lsquo;Child Development Course&rsquo;. We had a continental dinner - pasta, burrito bowl, broccoli risotto, nachos&hellip; I don&rsquo;t often consume this type of food. It was very new to me. I especially enjoyed the burrito, nachos, and falafal.</p>
<p>I shared my life updates with friends in detail. I was surprised that a few of them were regular weekly note readers. Meeting with friends, cracking jokes, sharing life updates was the best part of the trip. I am really, really grateful for all the friendships I&rsquo;ve made in this life.</p>
<p>Sunday: Nidhi and I went to &lsquo;Swadeshi Handicraft Mela&rsquo; with another group of friends. We heard from another friend that it&rsquo;s very affordable and interesting. I had the impression that handicraft melas are expensive, but we found very affordable and cool cotton shirts (ikat prints, block prints), Chikankari kurtas, cargo pants, and more. We also met some artisans from Kutch and bought handmade cushion covers from them. We also bought a wooden key stand. It&rsquo;s cute but was an impulsive and costly purchase. We spent more than 5K but got an amazing stock of clothes, especially for me because I don&rsquo;t easily find cotton cargos and shirts at this price. Nidhi also got some interesting items for herself.</p>
<p>Monday: We gave an ice cream treat to all the course participants. In the evening, we screened &lsquo;Laapataa Ladies&rsquo; in the workshop hall. Most of the audience was female. It was a nice experience to watch it together.</p>

<p>we bought books from Eklavya Pitara store for our office &amp; some selected nature related story books for Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions at learning center.</p>
<p>We took a train to Ahmedabad on Tuesday night. On the opposite berth, there was a 4-5 year old child with her parents. I asked her if she wanted to listen to a story from big book. We ended up exploring &lsquo;Saljam&rsquo; together as we traveled.&quot;</p>

<p>Wednesday: We are back in Ahmedabad. I will join the office tomorrow. This week will be busy. We have a summer camp at Ravi bhai&rsquo;s office on Saturday-Sunday. I am going to take a one-day session with a school associated with our office.</p>
<p>We made progress on our financial planning front. We bought health insurance for both of us. It was tough to think about, compare the plans, and figure out if it was the right decision or not. Our friend, a financial advisor, helped us a lot by listening, clarifying our doubts, and reassuring us.</p>
<p><a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/education/central-government-trying-to-scrap-bachelor-of-elementary-education-course-of-delhi-university-and-bring-in-integrated-teacher-education-programme/article66965018.ece">I got to know that Delhi University&rsquo;s B.El.Ed course is shutting down</a>. Two of our faculty members are associated with the same course. It&rsquo;s sad to hear about this. It&rsquo;s the most comprehensive course I&rsquo;ve seen for teacher education, with a nice balance of practice and theory.</p>
<p>This time during the child development workshop, I was observing other faculty members - how they take sessions, how they go slow, explaining concepts with examples and analogies. I do the same, but sometimes I hurry, don&rsquo;t go deeper, give monologues, don&rsquo;t use the blackboard effectively, and just talk.</p>
<p>They facilitate deeper understanding of concepts, whereas I sometimes jump straight to classroom application.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;ve come a long way with my facilitation style. I will keep all this in mind for the next workshop.</p>
<p>Today I had my first mango of this summer - &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banganapalle_%28mango%29">Banganapalle</a>&rsquo;.
For dinner we went to atithi restaurant for aam ras &amp; roti :)</p>
<p>Mummy is doing okay. She took Papa for an eye checkup. We found out that Papa needs to undergo cataract surgery. They found a hospital where they perform the surgery for free. I need to take leave from the office and accompany them for this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hegde_seema_/">Seema</a> started writing <a href="https://seemateeta.blogspot.com/2025/04/week-15-of-2025-sunday-to-saturday.html">weekly notes</a>. She is Horticulturist 👩🏻‍🌾❤️‍🔥, Phytophillic ☘️ living in a village called Hosalli in Sirsi, Karnataka. She writes about farming, gardening, books and other stuff.</p>
<p>I am realizing that I am an attention seeker, egotistical person. I want to be in the good books of everyone, I always want to prove my point and be on top&hellip; in my universe I am at the center. What should I do to be grounded? Listening is one thing I want to focus on from now onward.</p>
<p>Last year, Nidhi translated a book called &lsquo;There is nothing there&rsquo;. Now it is available as printed copy. You can buy it from <a href="https://ncf-store.zohocommerce.in/products/there-s-nothing-there-hindi/1638627000002181312">NCF Store</a> / download it as pdf from <a href="https://www.natureclassrooms.org/theres-nothing-there-book">Nature Classroom Website</a> (There is very interesting game based on this book, check it out !)</p>

<p>We made drumstick sabji on Monday evening. It is my favorite sabji. I love how my mom makes it. We tried our best to make it edible&hellip; the taste wasn&rsquo;t exactly like mom&rsquo;s, but it was nice. It was fun cooking together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mukherjiantara_art/?hl=en">Antara</a> gifted us nice paintings as a wedding gift. I gave one of the paintings for framing. I realized that wooden frames are quite costly. I&rsquo;m waiting to see how it will turn out.</p>
<p>I went to physiotherapy on Thursday. My height + long sitting hours + 20 to 25km of everyday driving on Activa + no exercises have all contributed to lower back pain and shoulder pain. I also started some basic stretching, applying ice packs, and taking breaks from sitting. I am in a much better state right now, but the pain is still there.</p>
<p>We had a call with <a href="https://www.youcan.in/">Ram - Rachita</a> on Friday. I was so happy to see them on screen after a long time.</p>
<p>We took on a nature education curriculum/module development project for grades 6 to 9. There is already wonderful work and content creation happening by <a href="https://palluyirtrust.org/">Palluyir Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.ncf-india.org/">Nature Conservation Foundation</a> (early bird, nature classroom, season watch), Wipro Earthian, and more. We are trying to curate and make it more contextual. Let&rsquo;s hope we create something meaningful.</p>
<p>I have developed and now manage two schools&rsquo; websites on <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. It&rsquo;s a nice, easy-to-use platform for basic stuff. This year they increased the price of their basic annual hosting plan from 2,338 Rs to 3,540 Rs (18% GST included). I think this is too much for our use case. Changing the platform and transferring the content is a task&hellip; let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t had the mental space to work on the &lsquo;Voices of Vishwamitri&rsquo; website. I need to focus on it this week.</p>
<p>Nidhi completed 4 sessions at the learning center. She is taking two sessions per week. Both the children and Nidhi are enjoying the sessions. I will ask Nidhi to share her documentation link so I can share more about the sessions.</p>
<p>Mom is at Padra. One week has passed. I talk to her on the phone almost every day, but I still miss her presence.</p>
<p>Next week on Wednesday, Nidhi and I will leave for Bhopal - Child Development Course at Eklavya. It will be a busy week. I am excited to meet all the friends.</p>
<p>I wrote a post on <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/tantra-in-day-to-day-life/">Tantra Vidya</a> in Gujarati based on Subhash Bhatt&rsquo;s video.</p>
<p>Today, we had a meeting with a financial advisor to start our investment and tax planning journey. It feels weird sometimes&hellip; we are now adults thinking about tax, investment, medical care, yoga subscriptions, and health supplements. By the way, let me know if you have any recommendations for protein powder and multivitamin supplements.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I am still reading &lsquo;Tilor&rsquo;. The story is progressing slowly, but the plot is very interesting, so I am continuing it. I may read &lsquo;Mane Fom Chhe&rsquo; in parallel.</p>

<p>I feel that I am constantly fighting. Fighting with &lsquo;convenience&rsquo;. Or fighting for convenience?</p>
<p>I lose every day&hellip; every hour&hellip; every minute.</p>
<p>In Ahmedabad, 39 to 40°C was the average high temperature last week. I feel guilty every time I switch on the AC in my room. I get images of fruit vendors, delivery people, and others in my mind. How are they living? I press the remote finally and keep the AC on for about 30 minutes or so&hellip; I start feeling anxious&hellip; &ldquo;The electricity bill will be high&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I doing the right thing?&rdquo; I switch off the AC, open the window, and try to acclimatize.</p>
<p>Last night I woke up in the middle of the night&hellip; I was sweating&hellip; it was too hot even at midnight. I switched on the AC&hellip; but my sleep was gone&hellip; I was fighting&hellip; fighting for convenience.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I had a discussion with Nidhi about not using plastic bags in the fridge to separate vegetables. We can use something else&hellip; or even spend time separating them when we want to prepare food. But she feels anxious if things aren&rsquo;t in place. Are we that busy? I think yes, we are busy&hellip; should I blame the system?</p>
<p>We took some cloth bags and transferred the vegetables into them.</p>
<p>Our composting project is still waiting for our attention. Hopefully in the coming week.</p>
<p>One part of me dreams of a day where I only do mundane, day-to-day work like cooking, washing utensils, cleaning, and more&hellip; if someone were to pay all my bills. Would I really thrive living like that? Would I eventually feel the urge to do something &lsquo;more meaningful&rsquo;? What if I don&rsquo;t create any value or meaning in my life?</p>
<p>What should we make for dinner? For breakfast? It&rsquo;s a daily question&hellip; On Saturday evening, we went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kamla_sewa/?hl=en">Kamla Cafe</a>. During dinner, we were talking about &rsquo;taste&rsquo;. How generation by generation we are losing the taste&hellip; taste of traditional food, fruits, vegetables&hellip; Maggi masala and tomato ketchup are taking over all our taste buds&hellip; things are changing very rapidly. Another part of my being says, &ldquo;Organic stuff is very costly&hellip; it is another scam of capitalism&hellip; Maybe one day I will have my own farm? How can I support a larger ecosystem for sustainable farming practices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of my friends, Chetan (a KA Shala alumnus), is selling milk and other organic products. I have known him for years and can trust the quality of the products he sells.</p>

<p>I bought tickets for a live concert by Papon in Ahmedabad. This will be our first concert experience. I was reading FAQs on the site and realized that we can&rsquo;t take water bottles with us, just because they want to make money by selling packaged water bottles and creating tons of plastic waste. Very disappointing.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="23rd-to-30th-march-2025-sunday-to-sunday">23rd to 30th March 2025 (Sunday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>This week was hectic again. Meetings, calls, outings and work.
I am having shoulder, neck and lower back pain. It feels like my body hasn&rsquo;t rested for months. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I daily travel 20 to 24km on my Activa. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of stress? It&rsquo;s more painful than I thought. I need to figure out some exercises to get rid of this.</p>
<p>After a year of writing weekly notes, I&rsquo;ve developed some guidelines :</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be selective about what I share publicly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office details remain private, though I can mention celebrations like Holi or special events</li>
<li>No workplace photos</li>
<li>Always get consent before mentioning names or sharing photos of others</li>
<li>Draft everything in private notes first, then curate what goes public</li>
<li>Be aware while writing about issues at home</li>
</ul>
<p>What to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool stuff I&rsquo;m reading, watching, or exploring</li>
<li>My latest experiments and tinkering</li>
<li>Personal projects and how they&rsquo;re coming along</li>
<li>How I&rsquo;m feeling overall</li>
<li>Interesting conversations and stories</li>
<li>Quick updates about life</li>
</ul>
<p>With Monday to Friday consumed by work, I&rsquo;ve decided to dedicate Sunday evenings to this practice. I&rsquo;m setting aside two hours to reflect on the full Monday-Sunday week, even if that means occasionally missing late weekend updates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to value these notes as an important weekly ritual—a chance document and share my journey.</p>
<h3 id="23rd-march---sunday">23rd March - Sunday</h3>
<p>I skipped going to Navjeevan Trust on Sunday. Instead, we (Nidhi, Mom, Mihir) went to watch the Gujarati film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/hi/title/tt23556594/">&lsquo;Fati ne&rsquo;</a>. It was a Horror-Comedy film, a new attempt in Gujarati films. We enjoyed it. I felt that it was a little too long&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="24th-march---monday">24th March - Monday</h3>
<p>We had our first planning meeting for Khojbeen Mandali. We discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are our learning objectives</li>
<li>What is our target age group</li>
<li>How we will document the whole thing</li>
</ul>
<p>Nidhi will take two weekly sessions at Anusandhan Learning Center.</p>
<h3 id="25th-march---tuesday">25th March - Tuesday</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We were looking for a summer intern to work on Khojbeen Mandali, but we didn&rsquo;t get good applications. Mostly freshers have applied. Also, the work is only for two months, the honorarium is low, and it&rsquo;s onsite work, not a remote job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This internship is a good opportunity for someone who is based in Ahmedabad and wants to kickstart their journey in nature education or educational research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="26th-march---wednesday">26th March - Wednesday</h3>
<p>We had a short online meeting with dear friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spidersandthesea/">Chetna</a>. We discussed Khojbeen Mandali. She shared some wonderful insights and ideas from her experience of working with children. I felt very positive and inspired after this meeting.</p>
<h3 id="27th-march---thursday">27th March - Thursday</h3>
<p>I attended an online meeting of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voicesofvishwamitri/">Voice of Vishwamitri</a> (a group of citizens working on environmental and developmental issues of Vadodara city). I wanted to attend the meetings and get involved in action but couldn&rsquo;t attend earlier because of my busy schedule. We need to make a website for the work happening around Vishwamitri river. We had a discussion around the same. I will try to make a basic prototype as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="28th-march---friday">28th March - Friday</h3>
<p>Met dear friend <a href="https://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~malay.dhamelia/">Malay</a> after a long, long time&hellip; almost after 8 years. We chatted about design thinking, aesthetics, wonder, awe, technology, work, education, life and more&hellip; He recently joined IIT G. We will try to meet frequently. This meeting was the highlight of my week.</p>

<p>We bought a mobile for Mom. She never owned a personal mobile till now (strange, right? But it is real). Instead of ordering online, we went to the nearest mobile shop and bought a Vivo model for 15k. It&rsquo;s a basic smartphone with 8GB RAM + 128GB storage. It&rsquo;s enough for Mom&rsquo;s usage. I didn&rsquo;t do research or even check the price online. I didn&rsquo;t want to go into my overthinking loop. Also, I wanted to give her the touch and feel of the buying process.</p>
<p>Nidhi wanted to do something around documenting bio diversity. We started with identifying and note down trees in our apartment compound. I am really happy that we could start this.</p>
<h3 id="30th-march---sunday">30th March - Sunday</h3>
<p>Mom went back to Padra. Nidhi and I went to drop her at Geeta Mandir bus stop.
After that, we visited Navjeevan Trust Campus. We got a surprise&hellip;
There was a farmers&rsquo; market happening there—&lsquo;Srishti Khedut Hat&rsquo;. Nidhi was super excited to see this. A few alumni of K Shala were also holding a stall there. I was super happy to meet them. We had lunch at their stall.</p>

<p>I was trying to find my old Gujarati textbook from grade 10. I wanted to read stories from it and go on a nostalgia trip, but couldn&rsquo;t find it. The textbook board has changed the textbooks. I want a textbook of grade 10 from 2010.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://amarkathao.in/rasikbhai-raso-varta-in-gujarati/">&lsquo;રસિકભૈ રસો&rsquo;</a> on the internet. I loved reading it&hellip;</p>
<p>We had an online sharing meeting with 2 of our friends who are also working in the nature-science-education field. We shared our current work and life updates&hellip; we decided that we will do this every month. I felt connected and hopeful after the meeting. Thank you Nidhi for initiating this.</p>
<h3 id="current-reading">Current Reading</h3>
<p>Almost finished &ldquo;Electric Train&rdquo; but needed a change of subject, so I started reading &ldquo;Tilor by Dhruv Bhatt&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="overall-mood">Overall mood</h3>
<p>I am so happy to see how Nidhi and Mummy are bonding.
I&rsquo;m grateful that I got the opportunity to spend time with Mummy.
I was very anxious when Mummy was leaving alone for Padra in a bus.</p>

I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus &amp;amp; local train routes.

<p>It was a roller coaster week, the end part of the week was emotionally demanding.</p>
<ul>
<li>My parents went back to Padra on Sunday. I am living in Thaltej and my parents needed to catch the bus from Geeta Mandir bus stop which is 13km away from here. I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus &amp; local train routes. I was remembering the map man - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Planemad">Arun Ganesh</a></li>
<li>Managing wet waste, especially managing food waste is difficult in city/flat/apartment living. Doing composting when there&rsquo;s no balcony in your flat is difficult. It&rsquo;s also time consuming when both of us are working. What are some techniques I can implement? At my home in Padra we used to give food waste to dogs or cows on the street.</li>
<li>Aadhvan pointed out that my blog&rsquo;s RSS feed wasn&rsquo;t working. Images weren&rsquo;t loading in the RSS reader because the base URL was &rsquo;localhost:1313&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;learningwala.in&rsquo;. I figured that I was using the &lsquo;hugo server&rsquo; command to build the live site, which makes the base URL localhost. I changed my workflow. Now I&rsquo;m using:</li>
</ul>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo --baseURL &#34;https://learningwala.in/&#34; --cleanDestinationDir
python3 -m http.server</code></pre><p>It worked out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, I tried making markdown files from my accounts on Medium.com. I wanted to move all my old blog posts from Medium to my current Hugo site. I used Pandoc to convert HTML to markdown, downloaded all the images, added metadata, and changed image paths with the help of a Python script. Finally, I tried putting all the files in the Hugo folder. Some errors are coming up because of Medium&rsquo;s HTML elements. Now I&rsquo;m frustrated with this. I&rsquo;ll slowly just copy-paste all the posts in markdown. That will be better.</li>
<li>Went for a dinner at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafeaarambh/?hl=en">Aarambh Cafe</a> on sunday evening. Met Bansari.We need to plan meetings with Nidhi, Bansari, Vishnu, and one more with our office team.</li>
<li>At the office, it was a hectic week, mostly meetings &amp; presentations. We celebrated &lsquo;World Storytelling Day&rsquo; on 20th March. All the teammates made impromptu stories and acted out short skits.</li>
<li>Nidhi came back from Kanpur on Thursday. We went to Kamla cafe for dinner. Dadaji is back home from the hospital and on medication.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Now for the sad part of the week. There are extreme family conflicts going on. One more big reminder for me that patriarchy is real. It is very emotionally demanding and a test of life skills. I&rsquo;m grateful that Nidhi and my close friends are with me in this difficult situation. I went to Padra on Friday, and brought mummy with me to ahemdabad. Spent Saturday with Nidhi and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-else">What else?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next month I need to visit Bhopal for a Child Development Course. Need to plan things for the same.</li>
<li>Some more short projects are coming up apart from office work. Need to respond to that.</li>
<li>Need to kick start the work of &lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali&rsquo;</li>
<li>Need to plan camp for Sakha fellows</li>
</ul>
<p>overall mood is ok, sad - angry - frustrated - hopeful - at the moment I am ok. Thanks to Nidhi &amp; mummy.</p>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Still reading Electric Train. Nidhi was telling today that she will continue her &lsquo;Banaras book&rsquo;. I might buy one or two books from Navjeevan on Sunday. I need some variety in reading, but still first preference is &lsquo;Lalit Nibandh&rsquo; - essays and second preference is short stories or poems :)</p>
<p><strong>I am looking forward to this :</strong></p>

I want to add more photos, but GitHub Pages has only a 1GB repo size limit. I was considering setting up a Raspberry Pi or an Oracle server (similar to Amazon S3). Konarak suggested trying Cloudflare Pages instead. I created a project on Cloudflare Pages and found it surprisingly simple. Initially, I was manually creating my Hugo site on my local machine and copying only the &amp;lsquo;Public&amp;rsquo; folder to CF Pages. I wondered if there was a way to deploy directly from the command line. My first attempt wasn&amp;rsquo;t successful, so I had a short call with Konarak who helped me set it up properly. Now I can deploy my site with just a single command line - much more efficient than writing multiple git commands. This website now lives on CF Pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;  &lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;picture&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_15334863afe29ca1.webp&#34; type=&#34;image/webp&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_676e7a8564ccafc2.jpg&#34; type=&#34;image/jpeg&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;img&#xA;        src=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_676e7a8564ccafc2.jpg&#34;&#xA;        alt=&#34;cf pages&#34;&#xA;        loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&#xA;        decoding=&#34;async&#34;&#xA;        width=&#34;800&#34;&#xA;      /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/picture&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;      &lt;figcaption&gt;Github Pages v/s Cloud Flare Pages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://adhavansivaraj.xyz/&#34;&gt;Adhavan&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; weekly note and noticed he used a grid format for displaying images. I liked it and tried implementing the same thing on my blog. It took some time to figure out because I was already using shortcode for image handling and optimization. Using shortcode for both grid and image optimization together was challenging. I tried different AI tools to solve this problem - Claude, ChatGPT and Co-pilot. Co-pilot gave the simplest solution on the first attempt. ChatGPT was the worst, while Claude was average. They kept giving complex solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Watched the Gujarati film &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8982436/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Ventilator&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on a Marathi film with the same name. It was a wonderful watch. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was officially available on YouTube. Thanks to the algorithm for making my Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;10th-march-monday&#34;&gt;10th March, Monday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It was an office colleague&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so we went out for lunch with the whole team.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I had a call with Earth Educator Fellow Vimal who runs an organization called WildED. We discussed nature education, program design approaches, how to approach schools, and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I explored how to incorporate Gujarati fonts on my blog. I currently use Inconsolata fonts for English text. For Gujarati, I discovered a GitHub repository called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/samyakbhuta/chhapkaam&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Chhapkam&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, developed by my friends Samyak Bhuta and Kartik Mistry. With Co-pilot&amp;rsquo;s assistance, I figured out the process of uploading these fonts and configuring them to activate whenever I write Gujarati content in my blog posts or pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;11th-march-tuesday&#34;&gt;11th March, Tuesday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bansari (friend/colleague from office) took me to meet her friend Vishnu, who works at American India Foundation as a science educator. We talked about life &amp;amp; education (what else can I talk about!!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;13th-march-thursday&#34;&gt;13th March, Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We played Holi at the office. I&amp;rsquo;ve never played Holi at my previous workplaces and really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<li>
<p>We played Holi at the office. I&rsquo;ve never played Holi at my previous workplaces and really enjoyed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me &amp; Nidhi had a online meeting with Tanaya (from nature classroom). She is developing assessment tool to measure the impact of nature based learning intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched a film called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7790898/">Gujju Bhai - Most Wanted</a>&rsquo;. It was a fun watch. Again, thanks to my YouTube algorithm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="14th-march-friday">14th March, Friday</h4>
<ul>
<li>My parents came to Ahmedabad. Papa bought a second-hand Activa for me &amp; Nidhi. They drove from Vadodara to Ahmedabad. In the evening, we went to Palladium mall (we all wanted to spend time at the same place, and the mall was just 20 steps away from our home, so we decided to go there&hellip; it was fun discussing brands, packaging design, and fashion with papa).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="15th-march-saturday">15th March, Saturday</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Papa and I went to my office on the Activa. I wanted to check if I remembered the way. Though I wasn&rsquo;t confident, I surprisingly reached there very smoothly without looking at a map. I realized that now I have personal mobility. I&rsquo;ve never owned a vehicle before, mostly using public transport/Uber/Ola/Rapido. Most of my houses and workplaces were nearby, but now with my office 10km away and living in Ahmedabad—a happening city with drama, events, and literature-related talks—having a vehicle will be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a heat wave going on in Ahmedabad. Luckily, I go to the office early in the morning and return after 5pm, so I skip the worst hours, but it&rsquo;s still very hot and this is just the beginning of summer. I&rsquo;m very grateful to have a living space with AC and happy that I could offer air conditioning to my parents. Environmentally, AC is the worst thing to have, but when you live in a city apartment, it&rsquo;s difficult to choose alternatives. For most years in my career, I worked in remote villages. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m being pulled into city life&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am grateful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a new vehicle</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The opportunity to work with researchers. Currently at the office, I&rsquo;m involved in pilot activities with children where we test different hypotheses. There are proper observers/research associates documenting the whole process. I wish to move more toward the research side now. At Khojbeen (our nature-project-theater based learning initiative that Nidhi and I are nurturing), we&rsquo;re also partnering with Nature Classroom and hopefully with Srivi to research our intervention. <a href="https://www.sriviliveshere.com/">Srivi</a> is a wonderful researcher, artist, and educator. I would like to work with her on environmental aesthetics.</li>
<li>Reading a lot about aesthetic sense development lately. This might help me develop activity modules or conduct sessions. I wish to hold a session with my office team on this topic. Taking a session is the best motivation to study things in depth.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="updates-about-khojbeen-">Updates about khojbeen :</h4>
<ul>
<li>We had a meeting with Tanaya about assessment tool</li>
<li>We are in touch with srivi, we are planning to do research about aesthetic sense development in children through nature based intervention.</li>
<li>We published an invitation for summer internship positions with our team. We received a diverse range of interesting applications from PhD students all the way to 10th grade students. We&rsquo;re specifically looking for someone who is based in Ahmedabad, has a genuine interest in nature education, and is enthusiastic about working with children.</li>

If I stay in vadodra I can go to mangal bazar or local market of padra and get the stuff. Here it was difficult to find out local market. You need to surrender to places like Dmart or blinkit. I am very very grateful to Nidhi, she did all the setup for kitchen, rooms.. made the place homelike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Week was super hectic, new job, new home, new city :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me and Nidhi are slowly settling down here in ahemdabad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We came here on 29th and I joined new workplace from 3rd March. so we got some time to settle the our stuff, figure out breakfast, lunch places,vegetable - fruit vendors, bought some grocery - kitchen utensils. living in big city is difficult. If I stay in vadodra I can go to mangal bazar or local market of padra and get the stuff. Here it was difficult to find out local market. You need to surrender to places like Dmart or blinkit. I am very very grateful to Nidhi, she did all the setup for kitchen, rooms.. made the place homelike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>during Saturday and Sunday :</p>
<ul>
<li>I watched amazing documentary called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiL4ply2f44">Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai</a>&rsquo; based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Kumar_Shukla">Vinod Kumar Shukla</a>&rsquo;s life &amp; work.</li>
<li>Went to Navjeevan Trust Campus after long time. Explored their new book store called &lsquo;Hridaykunj&rsquo;. Got 2 new books. Banaras Dairy by Vivek Desai (English translation), Electric Train (Gujarati) by Geeta Nayak. Both the books were in my list to buy from long time. I bought banaras dairy in english so Nidhi can also read. She is from UP but never get chance to visit banaras, now a days she is making efforts to know and connect with her city - state. I was keen to read banaras dairy in gujarati, I was in doubt if I will understand and feel the content in english or not. Nidhi did loud reading of one of chapters. It was good&hellip; I can visualize.. accept when some unknown words come in..</li>
<li>We also had dinner at &lsquo;Karma Cafe&rsquo; at Navjeevan Trust Campus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

We are newlyweds, so family and friends are inviting us for lunch and dinner at their place. We enjoy going to friends&amp;rsquo; places, but at relatives&amp;rsquo; places, Nidhi needs to be ready in a saree or kurta with ornaments and all. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it, so it was tough for her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On 22nd Feb: we went to Mitali ben&amp;rsquo;s place. We enjoyed chatting with Mitali Ben&amp;rsquo;s mom and Jagat Bhai. It&amp;rsquo;s a family.. every minute cracking jokes happens.. very light environment, cricket, movies, puns, and more. I wish my family become like this. It gives you mental peace that everything is ok, we will handle it. At my place, it was like war was happening, strict, silent, needful talk only..anyway..&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w9.2025/mituben.jpeg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Description of the image&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Mitu ben&amp;rsquo;s place&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This week was super busy. Most days, we were out. We are newlyweds, so family and friends are inviting us for lunch and dinner at their place. We enjoy going to friends&rsquo; places, but at relatives&rsquo; places, Nidhi needs to be ready in a saree or kurta with ornaments and all. She doesn&rsquo;t like it, so it was tough for her.</p>

<p>On 25th Feb: we went to Anushree&rsquo;s place to have lunch. Anushree is a new friend from Vadodra. She contacted me for her research on karma &amp; shradha. Me &amp; Nidhi both participated in the research.. and became good friends.</p>
<p>She is from a Marathi family living in Vadodara. We enjoyed talking to her ajji and visiting her small garden in the compound. She is an upcycling expert, she made many interesting things for trash.</p>

<p>On 26th Feb: on Shivaratri, Nidhi and mummy-papa visited our community temple in the Narmada district called Nandikeshwar Mahadev. The roads were very bad and it was 3hrs journey. Everyone was tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we visited my mama&rsquo;s place for dinner (we visited 3 relative&rsquo;s places in one day.. it was overwhelming)</p>

<li>In between all these we did packing for our next move. One day mummy also came and helped us. It was very very helpful. It could take a longer time for me and Nidhi if she didn&rsquo;t come.</li>

<p>28th Feb: I &amp; Nidhi finally moved to Ahmedabad on Friday. Ravi Bhai offered us his flat to use for some time. So we can find a proper place to live. Finding a house in a big cities is a tough job. We both are very greatful to him.
Nidhi doesn&rsquo;t like flats/apartments, she likes old-style houses with open spaces, gardens, and all. I also like those but it&rsquo;s a luxury in the city.</p>
<p>Now a new journey is starting, finding a home, finding a workplace for Nidhi, finding healthy food options (we both have stomach issues) finding a cook, setting up stuff in a home, and transport options.. should we buy a scooter or not.. many actions are in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After reaching Ahmedabad. First setup after reaching to Ahmedabad  :</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="25th-to-31st-jan-2025-saturday-to-friday">25th to 31st Jan 2025 (Saturday to Friday)</h4>
<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zby_Sav6Y4">How Vinay Malge became the catalyst for Bidar&rsquo;s heritage revival | DH Changemakers 2025</a></li>
<li>tried osm mapping</li>
<li>did washing machine repairing at home with papa and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFSsmjuscyh/?img_index=1">session - Biology of Money in the morning</a></li>
<li>wrote summary about session published <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/biology-of-money/">blog post</a> and my prep note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>watched arun ganesh&rsquo;s interview</li>
<li>spent time to study adhavana&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>I tried OSM Go app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had short call with Thejesh GN about how to do survey of biodiversity / tree mapping.
he shared tool called kobo tool box (<a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">https://www.kobotoolbox.org/</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vidit came from the canada for few months. He is super confused and stressed about going back to canada.He is analyzing that should he stay in india and do the job or should he go back to canda and do hardwork to save money and come back.. it&rsquo;s classic immigration conundrum. We had long discussion, we went to vadodra, had lunch at nice gujarati thali restaurant called Kathivadi Darbar - Alkapuri. After that we went to buy Monitor screen for me. It was a long pending task to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we bought refurbished Dell E2421HN 24inch monitor in 5k and logitech wireless mouse and keyboard (K275) . I was very confusing during the shopping, I was comparing online price, which brand and technology to buy and everything&hellip; finally i took a plunge. it&rsquo;s nice quality not very slim and attractive like what I see online but it is decent. I am trying this new keyboard. It&rsquo;s a mechanical keyboard. After using thinkpad&rsquo;d keyboard it is difficult to shift to any other keyboard. let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I think I will like it in sometime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spent time in researching about the monitor. It is my habit. Which now I don&rsquo;t like.
I keep researching and justifying my decision. In this case I keep justifying my step to not buying IPS monitor because it was costly (8k) and I don&rsquo;t need it because I am not doing gaming or graphic designing work. But when ever I read that IPS gives good color accuracy and it is good for eyes. At that time my mind goes mad and it tells me to go back to shop and give back the monitor and buy another one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This confusion is very interesting. I am experimenting with it for low stack environment so I can learn and apply it in other situation also. I read about e - ink screens which seems best for the low eye strain and also for distraction free work.
People are making <a href="https://www.modos.tech/">e- ink monitors</a> and <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/">tabs</a>. Some people are trying gray scale on their existing monitors and phones. I also tried gray scale on my ubuntu device. It took some time to find out right tool to do system wide gray scale. Thanks to chat GPT. It was fun experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this whole thing is about how brain works. How we are taking a decisions. What we prioritize and why. I was remembering Paras Chopra&rsquo;s mental models. Also thinking about cognitive basis. finally I had chat with chat GPT which gave me some peace :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abhijit was in Vadodra to take session at oasis. I went to vadodara to meet him. We had a lunch at kathiwadi darbar. This is second time I am going to kathiwadi darbar in same week. After lunch we went to visit Aditya&rsquo;s maker space &lsquo;Forrest of us&rsquo;. They are doing very nice work. I am happily jalousie. At that day they were working on wast management of Vadodra marathon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also return the monitor I have bought. I had talk with suchakra and he suggested to buy new <a href="https://www.amazon.in/LG-IPS-sRGB-Height-Adjust-Display/dp/B0BRQT57RC/ref=mp_s_a_1_10?crid=1H4NH4KLPIHXP&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._T_qxcACiBpvKYmQSvgLsW4s0T3usIbvmqF8SRaqTAZgmWnAot7QBFC4w_L_7Yk126yZcmZo6wC6F2N4IFh4xu99ugCCcUuPqgybu-fdOhIPmTlBT3wDNqCPncem5er2gaNCjJlSokyZNYZY3G494MUKaWlimUjKyarCJZYXNvLuPohREB4SqZtimtiIB8pG5HbomJmwj40-e08oBVqQ6A.3w1owtm-qWWQ-HYXuIYhe21SIgrTQyiXSvKTTYbZyuc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=benq&#43;qhd&#43;monitor&#43;24&#43;inches&amp;nsdOptOutParam=true&amp;qid=1738175044&amp;sprefix=benq&#43;qhd&#43;monitor%2Caps%2C459&amp;sr=8-10">LG QHD monitor</a> which is good for reading, writing, coding. So I ordered at same shop in Vadodra. Suchakra also sponsored part of the total amount of the monitor as a marriage gift :) Very thoughtful gift&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got msg Radhika from Balgokulam. They are ready to hire my as learning facilitator. I was waiting for this confirmation since last 2 months. Finally it came. Now we need to finalize where should we go ? Kanisa or ahemdabd ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in last weekly note I have written that we will not go for jashdan and join kanisa but now game is changed.</p>
<p>→ Stability &amp; social life : ahemdabad is ok ok city. We can come to vadodara in two hours.
→ Finance : salary + grant<br>
→ Stimulation at work / meaningful work : it&rsquo;s seems interesting. Nature education for kindergarten children + I can continue sakha fellowship and local khoji work in vadodra. I can learn research part. It will be corporate style setting but I need to be flexible.
→ Nidhi&rsquo;s work / working together :  she can come to balgokulam, she can join anusandhan ngo , we can find new places</p>
<p>we had a long call with Mitali ben. She also suggested to go ahemdabd.
Now I need to think about winding up DEFY work in march and find out home and everything in ahemdabd. Still I am confuse, unsure, let&rsquo;s see.. universe will take care.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had a call with Ravi bhai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mostly spent time for office meetings/work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>overall good week,</p>
</li>

<p>Me and Nidhi are thinking about giving proper name and visual identity to our nature education work. Learningwala is there but nidhi is feeling that, it is my brand and my work, she is not feeling that she is part of it. So we have decided to create something new which we both can hold and nurture.</p>
<p>I was thinking about different names.. KhojBeen Mandali suck to my mind. Nidhi also liked it. I started reaching out to people seeking help in visual identity. Rachita called me and gave some ideas about how to start. I had a chat with Ipsa Jain, Ashra, Nipun Prabhakar, Jinal, Chaitali and few other folks about the same.</p>

<p><strong>Overall mood and other things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall I am happy. Work at DEFY is going well.</li>
<li>I am happy that my and nidhi&rsquo;s friends are coming to our wedding</li>
<li>After eliminating all the options we have decided to go to <a href="https://www.ntpatelhighschool.org/">Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</a> from march. <a href="https://gopaldham.org/">Gopaldham</a> option is still open, today morning I had call with Varun. He is ready to accommodate both of us with salary we are expecting. The only thing is it is very remote area and we will feel alone. Here mitali ben is there, vadodra is near by so it will work out. I told varun that we will meet after 15th feb. We will visit the school so we can get idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly we will take a risk and go to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :)</p>

During that time I use to visit this school. Bharat came to my place when I was working in Bhuj. I was so happy to see them after so many years. Our relationship was not like teacher - students. We are friends. I am so happy that they are now working with children and trying to create environment which they got during k shala. They also shared the updates about other students that they are doing well in their respective fields and some of them are getting married soon.</p>

<p>Bharat and Dhara are going to work at shishukunj foundation, Bhuj. They are going to work with children from gov schools. Me &amp; Nidhi were thinking to visit them and do some nature education work with them. I felt that they are thinking limited scope of work like doing games and art activity with children. We can do lot more. We will talk to them. I it just thought, I never seen them working so I might be wrong.</p>

I tried to capture all our activities in one photo report - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canva.com/design/DAGaq8utmtg/O439oGkID5vYzoAcNmCFkQ/view?utm_content=DAGaq8utmtg&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;amp;utm_source=uniquelinks&amp;amp;utlId=h2c229f4669#1&#34;&gt;Gulmohar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/2024-reflections/&#34;&gt;2024 year end reflections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to work with young people for so long. I wanted to design fellowship kind of program where they get opportunity to work on real life projects, travel, meet people outside of their circle. Finally it worked out. Friends from sai&amp;rsquo;s angel foundation + Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are working on something called sakha fellowship. We are launching it on 12th Jan. I spent time on developing all the ideas related to it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My health went down, fever, low blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am getting married on 4th Feb. Preparations are going in full swing. On 5th Jan relatives are going to come at home to write invitation card (Kankotri in Gujarati) so I helped parents to prepare for the same.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I did calculation of all funding and other money I have and how much I utilize in what.&#xA;Didn&amp;rsquo;t get proper calculation for salary money (money apart from grant).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="30th-to-7th-dec-2024-saturday-to-saturday-">30th to 7th Dec 2024 (Saturday to Saturday )</h4>
<p>1st Dec : we (Mihir, Nidhi and Mitali ben) met jagdish bhai (donor of kanisa school)
2nd Dec : spent time with Nidhi at her place. We went for a brunch at Cafe Bangalore. We mostly talked about the Job and future of our work.</p>
<p>at this point we have few opportunities :</p>
<p>We have eliminated these :</p>
<ul>
<li>creative school and other alternative schools in BLR</li>
<li>Moving to Cooore / Joining youcan</li>
</ul>
<p>Current options :</p>
<ul>
<li>Project DEFY and BeMe (Bangalore)</li>
<li>Balgokulam</li>
<li>Vapi home schooling group</li>
<li>getting funds and work at Mitali ben&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>going to bhopal, find out some work at Eklavya</li>
<li>Shishukunj, Bhuj</li>
<li>varun khimani jashdan - gopaldham learning center</li>
</ul>
<p>right now we both are feeling that Bangalore option is great financially and growth wise
but my family (specifically father) wants that we stay in Vadodra and do work here. We are feeling helpless.
we want to be near to our parents but other side there is a financial struggle, we will not get money in Vadodara.
we can definitely do good work if we get funding. let&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>4th to 7th dec - APU - Wipro Partners Forum 2024</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-to-14th-sep-2024">7th to 14th Sep 2024</h4>
<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>saturday evening Mitali ben came home and had a talk with Me and Nidhi sapratly
after that we went to padra, had a talk with my parents. Main three things</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>golu should not live here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi should come padra often (once a week) and help mummy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to save money / they needed some financial clearity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>meeting went well.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sunday morning me and Nidhi came to padra, satyed till evening. Evening we (Mihir, Nidhi, Golu) went to SAF (sai&rsquo;s angel foundation)
one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; I have praposed two ideas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture</li>
<li>tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do</li>
</ol>
<p>most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children&rsquo;s enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.</p>
<p>I shifited back to padra.</p>
<p><strong>Monday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work. In evening I met <a href="https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/nihar-pandya">Nihar Pandya</a> at Gulmahor</li>
<li>My blood presure got down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to hospital</li>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to nidhi&rsquo;d place and worked form there.</li>
<li>it was difficult day for me. First of telling at home that I want to go at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. I was anxious. At nidhi&rsquo;s place it was difficult for me to listen golu&rsquo;s voice. I don&rsquo;t like the rude tone and other thing is whole routine stuff.. I can&rsquo;t see him like this. I shouldn&rsquo;t give this option of gap year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what else ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I randomly did msg to Yogen shah, wrong decision. His is just like I met him for so 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratham work is going good. Now I am confident about writing script, making poster and editing / making video in canva.
For canva part I still take help of Archi and Neha. They are pro. I need to play more with canva to make it normal for me. Just like I tinker with my website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sunday khoji club will not happen. I need to go for prayer of one relative. But children are very very excited. They ready with their tasks.
I see big hope to this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early bird approached for facilitating birdwalk in Vadodara. I am not sure we will able to do it or not. I will take final call today and email them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am learning to balance my time between work, Nidhi&rsquo;s place and parents place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Thursday I saw documentary on swami brahmvedantaji again. This is like 5th or 6th time. This I understood what is &lsquo;self - remembering&rsquo; and what is the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો હોંશ થી કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં તમારી હાજરી રહે એવી રીતે કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં પણ રહેવાનું છે અને સાથે સાથે આપણું મૂળ સ્વરૂપ પણ યાદ રાખવાનું છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there is real self without any filters. our ego is making this suffering more difficult.
we need to remember our true self each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too much gyan. It is simple practice.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="31st-august-to-7th-sep-2024">31st August to 7th Sep 2024</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>last saturday was working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday nidhi went to take a session at vinoba ashram with amit bhai. This time I stayed home. Took some rest.
If I go to a workshop it takes half of my Sunday and it&rsquo;s difficult to get a break on weekdays because of work.
It was difficult for me to decide because Nidhi needs support in session. But we had a chat and she agreed to go alone.
My evening session at sai&rsquo;s angel foundation got canceled because their office got flooded during heavy rains last to last week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday, Tuesday - hectic days at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday we went to Nisarag Upchar Kendra (Vinoba Ashram) to take naturopathy treatment for me and nidhi. It was a long due.
We got a new routine and diet. We need to eat Millets, fruits, soups :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday, Friday - again busy days at work. Following a new routine is fun + a little difficult. Especially since there are three people at home.
all three need to eat different things. Golu don&rsquo;t like millets and things we eat without masala. So we need to cook for everyone differently.
Nidhi and my diet has some common elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi is trying to manage new routine and her work (taking sessions with children and planning for the sessions). Right now most of her time is going in to cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the rains washing machine got damaged. Repair guy came yesterday and fixed it. It was a panel issue. I didn&rsquo;t give much attention..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the parents front : Mitali ben had a talk with my parents and now we need to go to meet them on sunday. I am super anxious about what I will talk about&hellip;
According to mitali ben they are ready for marriage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They just want</p>
<ul>
<li>ki me Nidhi ko financial support na karu apne pese bacha ke rakhu :) basically financial security</li>
<li>Nidhi jab bhi mere familiy valo se mile thoda friendly tarike se mile</li>
<li>they are ok ki hum bahar rahe..</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This Sunday I have my &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; session planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else ?</p>
<p>I am super frustrated with golu’s behavior. Talking in loud voice
Talking rudely with nidhi, seeing everything from lens of money.
Where I will get more money
Which thing is more costly, I want to grab that because it is costly = good / status
Not getting uncomfortable in anything</p>
<p>He is not following routine at all, all day watching reels or tarak mehta.. All day putting earphones in ears. Waking up like 10 - 11 everyday…</p>
<p>Actually I am ok with routine because, eventually he will get bored and find some activity to learn.
We gave some options like gym, swimming, coaching class for CUET exam, Ankur warikoo’s online course about communication, self learning math and other subjects</p>
<p>He is doing that online course sometimes, and sometimes he does self learning for math. other options are on hold because of rain and willingness
But it is like 2 hrs a day.. All the other time goes on mobile..</p>
<p>I am doubtful that mobile phones will not give the opportunity to get bored.
Let’s see…</p>
<p>Now I am feeling that we should have not called him here and let him do the college he was planning to do. Now it is too late</p>
<p>Few days ago my anger bursted and said something to golu which he didn’t like.
Today I will try to write a sorry email to him.</p>

It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="17th-to-24th-august-2024">17th to 24th August 2024</h4>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂</p>
<p>Also I wanted to support Nidhi. It went well. It was not a very well planned session but it was the first session and everything was new for Nidhi so she did planning according to her understanding. I gave very less time to planning. Next time we will do more tight planning.</p>
<p>I can see Nidhi growing as a facilitator. She is opening up slowly. She needs to learn how to judge the group and decide the activities.</p>
<p>Working with Amit bhai is a little bit difficult because of his expectations and ideas about the activities. But his intention is good so we will figure it out. We will figure out a way to work together.</p>
<p>Now the next workshop is on 2nd september so we need to work on the same. Topic is - ecosystem and interconnectedness</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Monday we were at home only, did home set up the kitchen and other stuff.</p>
<p>Tuesday we went to the office, Nidhi had a meeting with Amit bhai. Reflected on the session.</p>
<p>I did my pratham’s work. Evening we went to a restaurant. Amit bhai shared that Gulmahor will be not available for september so we have decided to work from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Wed, Thu, Fri and Sat - not been to the office. Worked from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Work wise it was a good productive week. I completed most of my tasks.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Whole week I woke around 7.30 to 7.40 (except today. Today I woke up at 8.13) and did stretching, reading for some time. Nidhi also woke up around 8 whole week. She also did stretching. I felt so happy that she did it without being negative. Today we did suryanamaskar together. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi made breakfast - lunch and dinner everyday. It was very good for my stomach and eating together was fun.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; We got Jio wifi on thursday. Now I can attend office calls without any limits and yes we can watch tv without any worry about data limit. It is useful and tempting both. We saw lage raho munna bhai and all india rank together (Golu, Nidhi, Mihir)</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Working with golu is tough for me. Waking up late, being sleepy and not active in the morning, watching TV or mobile all the time, connecting everything with money - fame - success, not focusing on tasks, being negative in doing physical activity. Eating chilen, not sleeping without AC. I took all the things on my ego. I got stressed about how we will go forward with this mindset.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a good discussion about the future plan. How to do projects and prepare for the exam. We saw all the courses on the internet but he is not sure what to do. So we decided to do projects and prepare for the common university entrance exam.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how everything goes. I am hopeful. I also want to learn how to work with teenagers of this background.</p>
<p>I saw that entrepreneurship is a common subject we like so we will do something about it. Today I gave him a challenge to sit without doing anything for two hours. Let&rsquo;s see he can do it. I will give 1k if I can. I know I should not introduce money in this but I can&rsquo;t help but think that other options are closed right now.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; What else ? Other things are ok. Whenever I think about situations at home, I feel stressed so I am engaging myself in other tasks. Not thinking about it. I am looking forward to the session at sai’s angle - saturday club. Yesterday Neha from Moinee foundation called me for curriculum development work, I am looking forward to that also.</p>

<li>
<p>prataham&rsquo;s work is going ok. on 14th I got new assignment to work on plasti literacy course. Writing scripts, assignments, course communication.
I am happy, I am enjoying it. I wrote the first script and Uma appricited it. I am taking it as a learning task. I am learning how to write for video format.
it is interesting, sometimes it feels meaningless when you rewrite according to people&rsquo;s feedbake. write - feedback - rewrite - repeat</p>

thoda bada jghda ho gaya, I am not going to padra back. Right now I am staying with Nidhi and Golu. Nidhi ne aur mene mummy ke sath achche se baat kar ke hamari man ki baat
bata di us vajhse thoda man halka hua. otherwise it was very very stressful situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not feeling setteled while living in this flat, I feel more setteled at gulmahor. sometome time I feel iriteted because of small small things from golu and nidhi
I need to learn to be calm, find my center. I have uninstalled instagram today and I need to leave linkedin too. It is having a bad effect on my mind. I need to set my rotion and stick to it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Came to gulmahor evryday with Nidhi</li>
<li>We (Mihir &amp; Nidhi) met harshal from wipro eartian on 7th august. It was wonderful meeting. We got to know that he runs interesting children magazine called &lsquo;Kulfi&rsquo; in marathi.</li>
<li>Nidhi worked on session planning</li>
<li>House huntting</li>
</ul>
<p>Sent this email to namrata di and vishal bhai :</p>
<p>આપણે વાત કરવા માટેનો સમય સેટ નથી થઇ રહ્યો એટલે મેં વિચાર્યું કે ઈમેલ જ કરું, શાંતિ થી પોતાના સમયે વાંચી શકાય</p>
<p><strong>અત્યારે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>મારુ પ્રથમ માં કામ ધીમે ધીમે ચાલી રહ્યું છે. મારે વેસ્ટ મેન્જમેન્ટ, કલામેન્ટ ચેન્જ વિષય પર વિવિધ વિડીયો માટેની સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાની હોય છે. મારો તો સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાનો પહેલો અનુભવ છે એટલે મને થોડી વાર લાગે, બ્રેઈન સ્ટોર્મ કરવા જોઈએ, ક્રિએટિવ કામ છે પણ અહીં આ લોકો એકદમ ફેક્ટરી અપ્રોચ વાપરે છે એટલે મને ખુબ સ્ટ્રેસ થાય.  ટિમ આખી રીમોટ્લી કામ કરે છે, એના ફાયદા છે પણ ગેરફાયદા પણ છે. કોઈ કલ્ચર અથવા કામ સિવાય વાત નહિ.
એક વખત રેઝિગ્નેશન આપવાની કોશિશ કરી પણ ટીમ લિડે કીધું કે તારું કામ બદલી નાખીએ એટલે તને થોડી મજા આવે :) આમ કરી કરી ને ચાલે છે. કેટલીક વાર બધું અર્થ વગરનું લાગે, કોઈક વાર નવું શીખવા મળે છે, મન ઉપર કામ થઇ રહ્યું છે..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ અહીં પાછી આવી ગઈ છે. એની ફેલોશીપ નું કામ શરૂ કરશે, અમિત ભાઈ અને બીજા એક બે મિત્રો બાળકો શોધવા માં મદદ કરી રહ્યા છે. અત્યારે 3 લર્નિંગ સેન્ટર ઉપર બાળકો સાથે નેચર એજ્યુકેશન પર કામ થશે એવું ગોઠવ્યું છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>હું અહીં રામેશ્વરી બેન ની સંસ્થાના બાળકો સાથે થોડો સમય વિતાવું છું. લોકલ ખોજી કરીને &lsquo;લોકલ સિવિક પ્રોબ્લેમ સોલવિંગઃ&rsquo; ઉપર એક કોર્સ લીધો. આ ગ્રુપ આપણા 12+ ના ગ્રુપ જેવું જ છે. એમની સાથે નાના નાના પ્રોજેક્ટ કરું છું.
એ લોકો માટે ઇન્ટર્નશિપ ડિઝાઇન કરી રહ્યા છે. હું વિચારતો હતો કે બીમી ના બાળકો પણ અહીં ઇન્ટર્નશિપ કરવા માટે આવી શકે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઈમ્પના અને સાત્વિકા સાથે અઠવાડિયા માં એક વખત વાત થઇ જાય છે. પોડકાસ્ટ વાળા પ્રોજેક્ટ પાછો શરૂ કરવાનો છે. કોશિશ કરી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ઘરે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ઘણી વાર મને લાગે કે અમે વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય ખોટો લઇ લીધો. એ વખતે નિધિ ને થિન્ક ટેક માં ન ફાવ્યું, એ બીમી માં સેટ થશે કે નહિ એ મને ડાઉટ હતો, ઘરે મમ્મી ને અને પપ્પા ની તબિયત સારી નહોતી રહેતી, સગાઈ માટે પણ અમે લોકો અહીં એમની સામે હતા તે સારું રહ્યું , જો અહીં રહેવા ન આવ્યા હોત તો સગાઈ માટે અઘરું પડત. આ બધું જોતા વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય બરાબર લાગે છે. પણ બીમી ને ખુબ મિસ કરું છું હું. મને ઘણા વર્ષો પછી મારે જેવું કામ કરવું હતું એના માટેનું પ્લેટફોર્મ મળ્યું હતું, પણ હું ચાહતો હોવા છતાં કામ ન કરી શક્યો.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ હમણાં લગ્ન ન થાય ત્યાં સુધી અલગ ઘર માં રહેવાની છે. એના ઘરે થી સાથે રહેવાની પરમિશન નથી, મારા ઘરે એવો કઈ વાંધો નથી પણ&hellip; + એનો નાના ભાઈએ 12 પછી એક વર્ષનો બ્રેક લીધો છે, એટલે એ પણ રહેવા આવવા માંગે છે એટલે એવું સેટ કર્યું છે હમણાં. ઘર શોધી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઘરે એક દિવસ મેં નિધિ સાથે વાસણ ઘસ્યા એમાં મમ્મી - પપ્પા ને બહુ ખરાબ લાગ્યું. એમને એવું થયું કે નિધિ મારી પાસે કામ કરાવે છે. મેં કીધું કે અમે બંને મળીને કામ કરી રહ્યા છે. પણ એ ન માન્યા, નિધિ કઈ મને ફોર્સ કરીને નહોતી બોલાવતી. બીજી રીતે પણ એ લોકો એવી એક્સપેક્ટેશન રાખે કે નિધિ જોબ ના કરે બસ ઘરનું કામ કરે.. પપ્પા ને તો  હજી આ સંબંધ ગમતો જ નથી, પૈસાની બાબતે પણ એમને એવું થાય.. નિધિ ની જોબ નહોતી ત્યારે મેં નિધિ ને મેં થોડી મદદ કરી હતી એમાં એમને વાંધો પડી ગયો.. કેમ એને પૈસા આપ્યા.. આ છોકરી બધા પૈસા પડાવી લેશે ને આવું બધું.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>મને બહુ જ ગુસ્સો આવે, પણ કોને કહું કેવી રીતે આમાં આગળ વધુ ખબર નથી પડતી, મને લાગતું હતું મમ્મી સમજશે, એ પણ આવી જ બધી વાતો કરે છે. તો હમણાં આ બધી વાતનો સ્ટ્રેસ ચાલે છે.</p>
<p>ચાલો હમણાં આટલી અપડેટ રાખીએ, પછી પાછા વધારે વાત કરીશું</p>
<p>આવજો</p>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-1st-june-to-8th-june&#34;&gt;From 1st June to 8th June&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mostly did office (Pratham&amp;rsquo;s) work. Had a call with my team lead. Had meetings with the team for a new content development project.&#xA;I am not enjoying work at Pratham fully because of sevral reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pratham is a big org. Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I am technically not skilled enough to develop content using AI tools. Young people in my team use AI like a pro. I sometimes run out of learning new skills and hold on to what I already know.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I mostly worked in small teams. Worked directly with the founder or team leads. where people know my skills and they value it. Give recongtion. Here I am one of hundrads. so I am feeling unreconigiesd.&#xA;not feeling part of the larger thing, not feeling belogingness. I don&amp;rsquo;t know this is good or bad but it is happening that much I know&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;also I feel that : do I really invest my energy in content development work or directly work with children but with clear vision and goals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In this week I took local khoji&amp;rsquo;s online session&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On friday my nanaji got expierd because of long time illness. Me and parents went to mama&amp;rsquo;s place&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wrote blog post called &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/working-with-youth/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Work with Youth&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It was a complex project beyond my expectation. event management + people&amp;rsquo;s ego management and what not..But I somehow finished it. I want to put photographs here but cropping and uploading is a little difficult when you are updating a website / blog from a local machine. I will put it on instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Whole week went in an engagement thing. It was a complex project beyond my expectation. event management + people&rsquo;s ego management and what not..But I somehow finished it. I want to put photographs here but cropping and uploading is a little difficult when you are updating a website / blog from a local machine. I will put it on instagram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pitched nature education to one CSR through rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO but didn&rsquo;t get a positive response. The person was more inclined towards STEM and career oriented intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesterday I met Amit Arora. He runs an NGO called Paper Ball Education. We have discussed how we can collaborate on the nature education front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to see Swara&rsquo;s house. It is a beautiful house. Let&rsquo;s see if everything works out. We will rent out that space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 15th Pratham work will start. So I am looking forward for that</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<p>This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.</p>
<p>Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &lsquo;Anubhti&rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.  </p>
<p>And alternative schools are only in the cities.</p>
<p>On the other side I got a call from my mother that my father&rsquo;s health is not good and it would be great if I will be there with family.</p>
<p><strong>What to do ?</strong> If someone passionately wants to work with children on a deeper level, alternative schools are the only platform I can see right now and they are not giving much salary. Waldorf schools, krishnamurti schools, democratic schools.. Another option is going to so-called progressive schools or international schools.</p>
<p>Most of the people working in alternative schools already worked in corporate for many years then they started school or started working in the schools. For them it is not their primary income source. For an educator full time doing this work with children for 10 years, there is no financial support system for them. There is no support system of like minded people whcih which most important thing for your growth and mental health.</p>
<p>Either they need to take side projects like consultancy or join the NGO / Development sector as manager roles. Even in NGOs ground workers who actually go and implement the program don&rsquo;t get much salary.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to tackle this thing is</strong>, if you have a partner who can support you. I saw in alternative schools one partner works in corporate and the other works in school.</p>
<p><strong>What about starting your own NGO or company ?</strong> The NGO world is highly dependent on CSR money or grants.</p>
<p>There are too many competitors and there are big players capturing the market. The game is who can do fund raising well. Who can show their work better. Who can scale things. Still there is hope because there are many companies, there is always the possibility to get small small projects every year. But this is a struggle every year.. if you see the larger picture, a 50 years old NGO also struggles to get funding. Instead of working with children, most of your energy goes to find funding</p>
<p><strong>Starting an educational company is the worst idea ever</strong>, a super cluttered market, very difficult to find product market fit. I have never come across company with really good product making money without taking money from CSR</p>
<p><strong>Ok let&rsquo;s come back to the point.</strong> So after a long discussion with Nidhi we have decided that we will not go to Pune.  We asked friends at  Eklavya Foundation if there is any work opportunity. But they are struggling with funding and extension problems so it will take 3 -4 months to materialize anything.</p>
<p><strong>Second option is :</strong> We will go to Vadodara so we can be with family. Now what about work ?</p>
<p>I said no anubhuti people. They are kind and sensitive enough so they understood my situation and supported me.</p>
<p>There is no established alternative school in Vadodara. There are one or two but they are very school and in their early stage. so the same problem. They will get parent volunteers so they will not need full time faculties.</p>
<p><strong>We thought let&rsquo;s start &lsquo;Nature Education&rsquo; work with children.</strong> Exprinatial - Project Based learning : That&rsquo;s what we know. We thought let&rsquo;s start working. For funding we will reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>We reached out to Akansha, Ravi bhai and Rameshwari ben for funding and many other friends to include them in our initiative as &rsquo;learning partner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also applied for a full time job at Pratham as Production Manager of Digital Content. It will be a remote job from Vadodara and once in a month I need to go to Pune. The idea behind it is, if I get it Nidhi will do full time work of Nature Education and we can have one income source in our bag if we don&rsquo;t get funding in future.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> we are waiting for replies from people whom we asked for individual grants.
Also waiting from pratham people to reply about the Job.</p>
<p><strong>The good part is</strong> when I reached out to friends at Vadodara saying I am moving back to vadodara. They were super happy and welcoming. I am really looking forward to the whole thing. It is risky, we don&rsquo;t have any backup, no savings, we need to support our families, at least I don&rsquo;t have any academic qualification and all to go back.. we are at in the ocean.. let&rsquo;s see what will unfold</p>
<h4 id="one-more-good-update-is---vadodra-city-walks">One more good update is - Vadodra City Walks</h4>
<p>we have launched something called &lsquo;Vadodara City Walks&rsquo; with children from Rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO.
20 teenage children are exploring water - river in their own city. We had our first orientation on 12th April. We will have our first session with them on 20th April 2024. I am very very excited for this. I had a talk with Siddharth (Veditum) for the same. He is very happy to help and guide me on this journey. I am super happy and greatful. Thank you so much to Jubin for connecting us.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say about this week. During this whole week Nidhi was not around. She is in Pune to find a job herself and a house for both of us. I was feeling low, anxious, tense the whole week..&#xA;we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say about this week. During this whole week Nidhi was not around. She is in Pune to find a job herself and a house for both of us. I was feeling low, anxious, tense the whole week..
we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..</p>
<p>My sleep cycle is gone, I am sleeping at 2 - 2.30 at night and waking up by 9 - 10 am.
I have become a mobile addict, not the reels or social media but reading / browsing other stuff.
specifically I have become <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> addict.</p>
<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<h3 id="-website-development">&mdash;&gt; Website Development</h3>
<p><img src="/w14/terminal.jpg" alt="Terminal">
<img src="/w14/terminal.jpg" alt="Terminal"></p>
<p>I spent most of my time this week in developing small small features in my website.
I wanted to escape from the situation so I engaged myself in learning new things and implementing on my website.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have redesigned page called <a href="https://learningwala.in/educational-practice/">&lsquo;Educational Practice&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>updated &lsquo;about us&rsquo; text in all social media (medium, linkedin, instagram)</li>
<li>implemented &lsquo;hugo-bearcub&rsquo; theme with CSS tweak and RSS feed set up</li>
<li>I have shifted all weekly notes in blog section with &lsquo;weekly-notes&rsquo; tag</li>
<li>Custom domain set up with cloudflare SSL certificate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--linkedin2md">- Linkedin2MD</h4>
<ul>
<li>I made a copy of my linkedin profile in markdown. I tried using the npm package (<a href="https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md">https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md</a>) but it didn&rsquo;t work for me so I used inbuilt resume builder of linked in and downloaded PDF and converted it into markdown. I did a little bit (actually a lot time wise) manual editing and adding / copy-pasting specific data from the linkedin profile which was missing in resume builder. Now I have a complete profile on my website which I can update anytime / send it to anyone. I need to put a PDF version of the same.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--medium-posts-in-markdown">- Medium posts in markdown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Medium changed its policy for readers, that was the one of the triggers to start this website and blog. I have been using Medium for the last 11 years so I wanted to take a backup of my old posts
and put it here in this blog. I checked the medium setting and downloaded all the files but it came in html format which is no use for me directly. I need to convert it into a markdown to put it here. I found and tried one python script and one npm package. The npm package didn&rsquo;t work for me. The Python script worked but it was converting one file at a time. I have lots of files. So I am stuck.
I am searching for another tool or I will try to tweak this script to do multiple files. If anything doesn&rsquo;t work I will do it manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--i-have-learnt-about">- I have learnt about</h4>
<ul>
<li>Github Workflow</li>
<li>How to use github issue as comment box on your website</li>
<li>using Prose.io as CMS</li>
<li>Fediverse</li>
<li>self hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>I will implement these all features in later on, not in priority. you can see what I am work on website <a href="http://simp.ly/p/W6Xjkf">here</a></p>
<h4 id="--custom-domain-email">- Custom domain email</h4>
<ul>
<li>Custom domain email id setup using zoho mail. I have created <a href="mailto:mihir@learningwala.in">mihir@learningwala.in</a> , I was searching for the trick so I can only forward emails written by humans to my new id from my gmail id. I didn&rsquo;t want any subscription / promotion / updates email to come on my new id. Finally I found something called &lsquo;filters&rsquo; in gmail where you can make rules for email forwarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use gmail for / at</p>
<ul>
<li>all the places / social accounts / subscription</li>
<li>for using cloud storage G drive (mostly if my collaborator is using it otherwise i mostly use markdown and simplenote for pretty much everything and for project management I use basecamp</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted my custom domain,it is fun to see and use.  Also I wanted to shift the communication part from gmail to a new custom email id. Where only humans communicate no machine generated emails. Custom domain email on google is costly. Also they only give 30GB cloud storage and if you use a normal paid account you will get 100 gb in 1300 rs yearly.</p>
<p>so I searched for other services which give custom domain email service. Price comparison, feature comparison</p>
<p>Migadu and Fast email came multiple times in the recommendation but finally I signed up for zoho mail. They are giving free custom domain email with 5GB email space. I have tried this service before for some time with my old domain learningwala.com. So I was familiar with it. If only humans talk 5GB is space and if it exceeds the limit/ needs more features the price is 58.34rs per month.</p>
<p>Apart from gmail I was using hey.com / hey email by 37signals (makers of basecamp). It is paid service after a one month trial. But I wrote to them that I really like the service and the price point you are offering (99$ yearly) is not affordable for me. They gave me a 1 year free subscription. I really liked the product and spacilly the desktop and mobile app with clean simple UI and their workflow features. I love writing emails in those apps. But finally I have decided that I need to move on because two reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>dependence on them for the pricing. I can afford to give 8000 rupees yearly for the email service.</li>
<li>I want to try a custom domain which is more costly then normal email on hey. So finally set an auto responder on hey account saying please email me on my new email id.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="--history-of-my-email-ids-">- History of my email ids :</h4>
<p>I have started with live.com / hotmail / outlook mail</p>
<p>Past :</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="-wix-payment">&mdash;&gt; Wix Payment</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have done mitaliben&rsquo;s school website domain and hosting renewal. It was difficult to do payment on wix because they only accept cards. I got new card from bank in that net banking / international purchase is not active. I tried another friend&rsquo;s card but it didn&rsquo;t work.. finally my axis bank debit card worked. The friend gave the idea that you can activate international purchases from your axis bank app. I quickly downloaded the app, and it worked.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-call-with-rameshwariben-2nd-april-2024">&mdash;&gt; Call with Rameshwariben (2nd April 2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had a call with Rameshwari ben, she wants to do some activities related to nature / environment with teenage children at her NGO. I did some research and planning for it during the week. I was thinking if we can focus on the river. Visit river, interview, nature journaling, season watch, bird watching, mapping, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have reached out to <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/people/faculty/ankush-gupta">Ankush from HBCSE</a>, <a href="https://yourstory.com/herstory/2022/06/world-environment-day-young-conservationist-plastic-crocodiles-sneha-shahi">Sneha</a>, <a href="https://veditum.org/">Siddharth from Veditum</a>, if they can help us in water testing and other river related activities. Ankush and Sneha replied promptly, they said they can connect me with MSU environment dept and Navrachana university, Sneha will send my requirements to her friends in vadodara so they can help. I also reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhushri-mudke-7398b030/?originalSubdomain=in">Madhushree from ATREE</a>, she sent some amazon links to buy water testing kits, Ankush also sent one link for kit.</p>
<h3 id="-writing-about-tools-for-self-directed-learning">&mdash;&gt; Writing about tools for self directed learning</h3>
<p>I have started writing about tools for self-directed learning. What are the tools which can help you in doing self directed learning? I am reflecting on my journey, observation of BeMe children, Conversation with Nidhi and Nidhi Solanki</p>
<p>some of the tools I have identified :</p>
<ul>
<li>Note taking</li>
<li>how to make your portfolio (how to document, your own narrative writing, website or other medium)</li>
<li>how approach people/ communication (cold emails, networking, researching about people - org - project - anything )</li>
<li>how manage your tasks, how to work in team</li>
<li>what is the goal of internship and how to find one</li>
<li>how to prepare yourself for internship</li>
<li>list of places where children can go and work (different location, different subject)</li>
<li>list of mentors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting resource - <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">https://www.recurse.com/self-directives</a></p>
<p>I want to write how you can learn these tools so you can implement them during your sdl journey. I will publish it after I finish writing it.</p>
<h3 id="-seeing-karnataka">&mdash;&gt; Seeing Karnataka</h3>
<p>For the last two semesters in BeMe, I was part of an elective course called <a href="https://howaboutseeingbeng.wixsite.com/seeing-bengaluru">&lsquo;how about seeing bengaluru&rsquo;</a>. Namrata wants to make something similer around karnataka. &lsquo;Seeing Karnataka&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have did some research during the week. Also did some reflection on what we learnt from the last two semesters.</p>
<h3 id="-i-met-konarak-ratnakar-aka-kondi-3rd-april-2024">&mdash;&gt; I met Konarak Ratnakar aka Kondi (3rd April 2024)</h3>
<p>I heard about him many times from common friends like samyak bhai, malay, kartik bhai with ref to Gujarati wikipedia, maker, geek and hill hacks. These all friends are from Vadodra / Ahemdabad CEPT Fablab , Maker Fest</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.&#xA;I was in constant stress about Nidhi&amp;rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.
I was in constant stress about Nidhi&rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..</p>
<p>On the other side communication - coordination with parents about engagement planning is going on. They are not happy that we are moving to pune without any financial security.</p>
<p>Yesterday Nidhi went to Pune for interviews and visited a few alternative schools. I am praying, hoping something will work out. Over friend Nirmala is getting enage on 12th so we are planning if we can attend the function while coming back from Pune.</p>

</ul>
<p>After I redescoverd about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> recently I was remembering other techies in this ethos.

<p>This week I spend lots of time in making - remaking - fixing and adding content to my personal website using hugo server and github pages. I learnt that text editer is importnat part of coding process. first I used sublime text and because of that hugo server was giving some error. I shifted to ubuntu defult text editor and somehow I managed to work. From last few days ubuntu was giving some glitchs on my laptop. specificly about sound and bluetooth. Sound was not coming and bluetooth was not connecting to my boat blootooth speaker. I tried different driver and fixing stuff using ubuntu forums and other websites but no sucess. Finally I re installed ubuntu. Before that I tried using and lots of reading about Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora.. I installed Pop OS but not satisfied with it, tried Manjaro but I didn&rsquo;t like KDE. Finally I came back to ubuntu 22. During this process of making website I reserched a lot about :</p>
<ul>
<li>static site genrator like hugo, pelican and more</li>
<li>Minimal - indie web blogging platform</li>
<li>Personal wiki and note taking tool</li>
<li>linux distro like manjaro, arch linux</li>
<li>How to use dynamic page and CMS in wix.com</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhxznWkXYAAsJch?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="linux distro"></p>
<p>I know these all are rabbit holes, i spent qite a lot of time to read hackernews this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t spend much time on instagram or other social media.</li>
<li>I am happy that I learnt to make website using hugo and github pages.  I wanted to use hugo-bearcub theme but it is giving some error. Currently I am using hugo-bearblog theme</li>
<li>making your personal wiki using <a href="http://simplenote.com/">&lsquo;simple note&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>I refreshed my knowldge about git , markdown and basic terminal code</li>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg" alt="Aaron "></p>
<p>that lead me to watching <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s</a>  documetry called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo;s own boy&rsquo;. Yes I know I discovered it very late but I was amazed by watching it. it is very very thought provoking. After watching documentry I spent quite a lot of time reading about open data work of <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">thejesh GN</a> and other people. <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta</a> is also doing wonderful work of putting educational / children litreture in public domain through his website and using internet archive.
