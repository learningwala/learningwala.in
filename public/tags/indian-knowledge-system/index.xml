<ul>
<li>
<p>At this age, skills are given in seed form — not as formal training but through play, rhythm, imitation, and imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teacher/parent’s role is to model beauty, order, joy → the child “absorbs” the Kalās naturally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Kalās that in Indian tradition appear as refined arts (music, crafts, riddles) are given through playful, child-suitable forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can includes some things as long term practice, some things as one of exposures. For example we can include art, hand work, music, drama in schedule as long term practice. Weaving cloth kind of thing as one of learning experience / project theme.</p>
