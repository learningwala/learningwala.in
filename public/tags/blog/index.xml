I would be delighted to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s Teacher&rsquo;s Day, and I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Just as a musician has their riyaz (daily practice), and a writer has theirs, what would you say is the riyaz of a teacher? What should a teacher engage in every day—not tied to any particular subject or grade, but as a practice of life itself? Could you share 2–3 such practices that you personally follow? I would be delighted to hear them.</p>
<p>I want to give more interesting prompt. Think about something which is not directly connected to classroom teaching.. for example doing yoga or doing nothing for 10 min everyday.. will that help in my interaction with children? Think about looking the same tree every day.. will that help&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="responses-">Responses :</h2>
<h3 id="srivi">Srivi</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just the act of listening without being clouded by judgement or one&rsquo;s own emotions, I think is a good practice.</li>
<li>Being honest with yourself and not trying to be perfect, and acknowledging that teaching-learning is hard work, and you will have your own disappointments and frustrations, anger and fear and not trying to underplay these, but discussing them with the right peers or with students thoughtfully.</li>
<li>Keep learning something for yourself, something that you enjoy, not because u want to teach it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="antara">Antara</h3>
<p>There are a few things I can think of -</p>
<p>Practicing gratitude and acknowledgement of the elements like sun, water and air not just in my head but when I am interacting with them&hellip;</p>
<p>Listening practice on my terrace - Birds sounds</p>
<p>Observations - plants, insects, worms, in my garden..
I also like to smell for unique smells in the dried fruits, leaves or compost bin,
I like to imagine and name the smells - amonia or sulphur
Hahaha&hellip;
Mostly this is my routine in the morning&hellip;</p>
<p>Current fascination is fermentation&hellip;and colour making</p>
<p>It directly connects to doing some exploration or experiments during nature walks&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; Also challenge them for what&rsquo;s bad, ugly, and keep a look out for hidden phenomena</p>
<p>When ( time of the day) the sun rays are soft on our skin warm and not hot vs. when the skin burns&hellip; transition from warm to hot&hellip; Experiencing it was fun For children</p>
<p>On the same line I chanced upon atmospherics in paintings and how monet use to paint only in a certain light and switched canvas as soon as the light changed&hellip;.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a city folk&hellip;I find it very challenging to come from a space of rest/settled state&hellip;</p>
<p>I also try affirmations in the morning -
Asking the universal will to attune me to what I need to attend today.
It&rsquo;s helpful the days I do it&hellip;</p>
<p>Lately I have realised most city folk are challenged by negative self talk and poor self care habits&hellip;</p>
<p>We are drowned in this condition and we just bounce around spilling it in the environment.. mostly unknowingly</p>
<h3 id="seema-hegde">Seema Hegde</h3>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>I had a teacher from my college, who is retired now, he used to say, one should always be up to date with the information. He was an exception among other elder teachers who would come to class without study and just blabber old, outdated things.</p>
<p>I think riyaz to a teacher (at least for me) is to refresh the lesson plan, no matter how many times it has been taught in previous years. There is always something new, which can be added this year.</p>
<p>Also, a teacher should always go beyond textbooks, experience hands on, expand their own knowledge, and in turn create interest in students.</p>
<p>For this, I follow a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading magazines</li>
<li>Learning with students, especially while answering their questions. You see one question leads to many new things,, its like a chain reaction</li>
<li>Doing things myself</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="samyak-bhuta">Samyak Bhuta</h3>
<p>Students are jiv, chetana no punj &hellip;.chetanan to pind &hellip;
Knowing what this jiv tatva is and what chaitanya it entails makes sense</p>
<p>I mean everyone is working with their material or dravya</p>
<ul>
<li>Musician has sound as material they shape it</li>
<li>Writers shape thoughts and prose etc</li>
<li>Coder shapes bits</li>
<li>Teacher shapes jiv tatva</li>
</ul>

<p>Good morning,
Beautiful question.</p>
<p>The first thing I practise every morning is <strong>&ldquo;NETI NETI&rdquo;</strong> recognising all the roles I play and remind myself I am beyond all of that, I mediate on the chants of nirvan shatakam every morning.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I take full responsibility of myself, my mind, my emotions and my body. I practise yoga 3 times a week, I dance, I go for walks, I am very particular about my diet (I let go fully when I am travelling or on a vacation)
I spend good time in nature, parks, rivers, ocean .. all of these rejuvenate me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I READ, I read a lot. All kinds of topics, I don&rsquo;t complete a lot of books if there don&rsquo;t hold my interest but I do explore. I also listen to podcast and audio books when I go for walks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love my family, very very deeply and I look after their needs, that keep me anchored and does not allow the rest of the things become centre stage.
I have very few friends but they are my life lines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Above all I keep a check on my self - Am I Happy, if not, then I check on what is the entanglement and I go back to <strong>&ldquo;SHIVOHAM- SHIVOHAM&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LXtNqL2vxoA?si=BksqMD2_A48Osacv">https://youtu.be/LXtNqL2vxoA?si=BksqMD2_A48Osacv</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Practice understanding</li>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Consume the best content (never settle for cheap entertainment)</li>
<li>Never regret your decisions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roohe">Roohe</h3>
<ol>
<li>Listening attentively</li>
<li>Being present and observant towards the child&rsquo;s needs- said and unsaid</li>
<li>Expressing your feelings to them with utmost patience and care instead of getting agitated</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Who is A Teacher?</strong></p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo clearly mentions that the first principle of true teaching is that nothing can be taught! What then is the role of the teacher?</p>
<p>A teacher is a role model, who points the way for students to unfold the knowledge that lies deep within them. Makes space for exploration, stays present and caring through many trials and mistakes and helps unfold wisdom that lies within. A Compassionate guide who holds space for self growth and learning to unfold. Helping students reflect and come to understanding within oneself. Who believes in each child&rsquo;s potential and helps children see this!</p>
<p>Being a teacher is a path of yoga, of hard work, self discipline, self development and cultivating compassion for others. Teaching is a Sadhana that can lead one to self mastery.</p>
<p>Let us take back the dignity of this role - from just teaching a skill to holding a compassionate space for the unfolding of ourselves and the young souls in our lives!</p>
<p>Happy teachers day!</p>
<h3 id="nidhi-gulati">Nidhi Gulati</h3>
<p>Mostly what I love is reading and writing, the more I read and write the better teacher I am becoming.
The second most important thing is to develop a sense of calmness and tolerance through breath work, walking, taking breaks</p>
<h3 id="reva-swaraj">Reva Swaraj</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reflection</li>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Non-judgemental attitude</li>
<li>Having courage to say you don&rsquo;t know</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="karishma">Karishma</h3>
<p>Waah! What a question!</p>
<p><strong>Mera riyaaz!</strong></p>
<p>~ Khush raho
~ Connect with your needs and the child&rsquo;s needs
~ Whatever is the question - Love is the answer</p>
<ol>
<li>Do something that you really like doing just for yourself.</li>
<li>Self work (meditation and introspection)</li>
<li>Laughing at non sensical something even if it feels fake</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ankita-apu">Ankita Apu</h3>
<p>Happy Teacher&rsquo;s Day!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the most important daily practices that I follow and I think every teacher should follow or think/ write/ make a voice note about how their day went and reflect upon it, what worked what did not work. This would involve how they felt when certain instances happened or when they were dealing with a particular child. As it helps, you plan for the next class, understand the child and yourself better which in turn helps you be a better teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think many of the teachers do this as a practice- to read or watch videos that would help you understand the age group of children you&rsquo;re handling, or more about your subject. Anything that can help you upskill yourself. This can also happen in a form discussion with your colleague. Not daily I would say but at least weekly once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily no matter how many classes you have facilitated to always go prepared and planned. To make a rough sketch of how you want to take things into class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, to have a support group could be your colleagues/ family/ friends to share your frustrations without getting judged. It&rsquo;s important for your mental and emotional well-being as a teacher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them are just basic things which many of the teachers follow. The last one I think is also important and at times neglected. Teaching and dealing with children is not always rosy.</p>
<p>I hope I answered your question.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Response:</strong>
Connected to my last point, yes, it would help.</p>
<p>To engage in your interest it could be drawing, taking a walk or as you said doing absolutely nothing. I do have an hour after I come from school and just lie down to decompress for an hour. Of course, it will be subjective depending upon the person&rsquo;s personality and interests.</p>
<p>Dancing is another go-to for me. Once in two months or at times every month when I feel overwhelmed or overworked, dancing helps me regulate.</p>

<p>Hello&hellip;
Yes, I would be delighted to share.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s not that I do the same practice everyday but yes with changing times and needs I do keep changing my Riaz but do it for sure&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Practice genuine relationship with children as a person (This includes being non judgmental, spend informal no agenda time, joke and lightheartedness)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice being attentive while you are in action (when you are planning the session, when you are interacting with children, when you are doing some activity, observing children). Be in shantam state and witness while in action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice of breaking conditioning / readiness to respond to new things. Being ready for new experiences, making yourself physically and mentally ready for adventures (Doing yoga, voice exercises, theater exercises, dance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to do mundane things with joy, attentiveness, wonder and beauty (Anything like washing utensils, cleaning, yoga.. anything and everything)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn new skills or explore new subjects which you are not going to teach (any nerdy thing), keep your curiosity and wonder alive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing as tool for thinking</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When I used to work with children, it gradually became very important for me to go back to school after dinner, around 6-7 pm when the girls had more time to themselves. To chat, meet, read together, work on library stuff, to do extra padhai. It became very important to be with them when neither of us were under pressure to conform to a role, a task or a value.</p>
<p>It greatly affected how I carried myself in school the next day, how I persisted getting over the resentment in what I felt school as a deeply conflicting space.</p>
<h3 id="jinal">Jinal</h3>
<p>Riyaz of attentive listening without judgement (to just the surrounding sound, not music or podcast or someone talking)</p>

<p>Hey! Such an insightful question..</p>
<p>For me - constantly learning myself is a non-negotiable.
Which requires myriad inputs - books, travel, conversations, courses, podcasts etc</p>
<p>Hence <strong>practice 1</strong> - Life-long learning.</p>
<p>The other is, reflection and reflective action.
Cumulative time to look back and constant awareness of actions as I perform them.</p>
<p>So <strong>practice 2</strong> is - Reflection and awareness (of self and other)</p>
<h3 id="all-about-child">All about child</h3>
<p>First of all Happy Teachers Day! Hmmm this made me think 🤔. Meditation is very important to keep a calm demeanour. Leave all your negative baggage behind before entering the school/ work space. Always keep the attitude of learning from your students.</p>
<h3 id="nav-nidhi">Nav Nidhi</h3>
<p>Spending time with children, be interested in them, loving them respecting them. I find this the most important. When this happens and when a connection is made, a lot of many things will start coming to the surface. I feel its also a process which unfolds in its own time and hence one shouldn&rsquo;t hurry. Dont take yourself too seriously, someone who is very knowledgeable and knows the best for the children, this attitude always comes in the way we relate.</p>

<li>Sitting quietly - doing nothing: I have found that I keep on doing one or other things like crochet or painting</li>

<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="deborah">Deborah</h3>
<p>Hi Mihir, thanks for sharing the question. I would love to hear your thoughts on this, too.</p>
<p>In comparing a teacher to a writer, or a musician, there are implicit assumptions of teaching being akin to an art, more specifically, a performing art. The specific content of what they teach is actually secondary to how they are able to interact with, and motivate students. This is a reason why subject expertise doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make one a good teacher, who is not dealing with empty containers to be filled with knowledge, but people with rich, complex inner lives who should feel motivated to learn.</p>
<p>This makes teaching a particularly hard occupation (I won&rsquo;t go into the issues of conventional teacher training which is still running with a factory model of education). I do believe teaching is a calling, and suitable only to specific temperaments (whether these can be learned would be another discussion).</p>
<p>The core of teaching lies in deep empathy, and developing the skill to channelise it into specific forms of teaching. How then to continuously develop this empathy? I think it comes from the practice of daily attention and reflection. Many good teachers maintain journals outlining their daily practices, and that becomes its own piece of learning over the years. Through such reflexive practices, they are able to hone the innate knack of teaching into an intuitive skill.</p>
<h3 id="sahmata">Sahmata</h3>

<h3 id="rachna-mam---msu">Rachna Mam - MSU</h3>
<p>Very interesting questions, thank you! Don&rsquo;t think anyone is interested in teachers or teaching processes in such depth these days 😁</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An important daily practice that never quite ends is preparing for class. That includes content mastery and upgrade, time planning and pedagogical preparation. How can the same concept be taught using 2-3 methods or approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Openness to curiosity of students as well as being curious oneself - this is tied to mastery. Once you master the content, it opens doors to more questions and more thinking out of the box using the same mastery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluating whether students have understood and received content without dependence only on exams or tests. This helps in fine tuning content as per interest and pitching your teaching at an appropriate level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathy and discipline need not be separated or seen as opposites&hellip;.but as a daily practice entails mostly listening fully without bias.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mitali-baxi">Mitali Baxi</h3>
<p>To me, this reyaz means:
To work on own self much deeper, much objectively.
Means, to grow cooler and cooler day by day by being more accepting, by understanding difference between expectations and real needs - of life.</p>
<p>I understand that when I grow wide, my increased compassion and acceptance connects me more with students and with all the people around children.</p>
<p>One more riyaz is to challenge own knowledge continuously to learn better for making students learn better.</p>
<p>What a beautiful question you asked!</p>
<p><strong>For everyday practice:</strong>
Reflection about the whole day is the key.
For that, I dine around 6.30 pm, turn off my internet after 8 pm.
And go to sleep between 10 and 10.30.</p>
<p>Also, whenever I get upset about anything, I start reflecting on it right in that moment.</p>
<p>(Till date I have found that any irritation has its root in me and only I can overcome it; the outer conditions are not at fault.)</p>
<h3 id="radika">Radika</h3>
<p>For me, it has been self reflection so far.</p>
<p>Another one,
Observing children, Noticing how they think, what excites them, where they struggle or what is something they don&rsquo;t like. Watching with curiosity rather than judgement</p>
<h3 id="bansari">Bansari</h3>
<p>For me it is otherwise around I think because I do some practices as a person or as a human being, and those practices makes me teacher.</p>
<p>The most important practice is to understand that everyone&rsquo;s reality is different there experience is a different and so the knowledge and their perception is. I practice this with all age groups. This practice also helps me to see every age groups as equal human beings.</p>
<p>Whenever I am asking a teach with a learning group, I do practice to put my self as I am. Also try to break stereotype of conventional teaching learning processes and perception of how a teacher is.</p>
<h3 id="muskan">Muskan</h3>
<p>What a lovely question :)</p>
<p>Happy Teacher&rsquo;s Day Mihir! 😁</p>
<p>For me, reading something and doing some form of exercise for physical fitness are 2 important practices.</p>
<p>Reading opens up my mind, and is fun!
Physical fitness helps balance my emotions, and thus allows me to understand myself &amp; others better :)</p>
<h3 id="suraj">Suraj</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting and takes a deep thinking</p>
<ol>
<li>Continuous Learning, upgrading knowledge, attending training, reading, reflecting&hellip;</li>
<li>Adjusting methods when something isn&rsquo;t work&hellip; Should have multiple methods to teach or learn&hellip;</li>
</ol>
<p>These are from my side 😊</p>
<h3 id="pratika">Pratika</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Roz naya kuchh padhte rehna. Har mamle mai updated nahi raha ja sakta. Lekin jitna jyada raha ja sakta hai utna rehna. Naya padhna naye ideas deta hai, naya nazariya deta hai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teacher ke role ki practice karna</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Teacher koi insaan hota hai. Aur har insaan ke apne belief hote hai. Ab chunki wo teacher hai buae poori tarah un belief se bhare teacher ae alag nahi kar sakte. Wo teacher samaj ke 10 aur role mai hota hai, sambhav nahi aesa karna. Lekin as a teacher uski kya bhumikaye hai, ye use yaad karte rehna chahiye, taki uske niji vishwas aur mantaye uske kaam pe havi na ho.</p>
<p>Jo kinaam taur pe har teacher ke ho hi jati hai.</p>
<p>Tabhi schools mai saraswati pooja ya admission nke time ygya-hawan hote hai. Ameer gareeb bachcho ke sath bhedbhaav hote hai. Apne role ko nibhane ki practice.</p>

<p>Hey Mihir,</p>
<p>Apologies for the late reply.</p>
<p>I think first thing for me is to bring myself back to the point where everything originated for me. Which is to ask is my work making way for more sensitivity and does it helps myself and others to understand the vast interconnectedness and expance of life, or does it merely conditions others with my point of view, making the mind dull and narrow.</p>
<p>Second thing is to not put myself at pedestal, especially when I am with kids. I try to learn with them. Thigh I miss many times.</p>
<p>Thirds is a fairely new one, as a result of realisation of socio economic injustice, I tend to draw away form places which serve only class. Which  is happening more and more into alternate spaces.</p>
<p>I thing quality education is for all and it should reach every child. Though it becomes difficult because ai have to earn and privileged space are usually the one paying teachers well.  But I tend to be aware of it, even if I have to do it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Who made the world?<br>
Who made the swan, and the black bear?<br>
Who made the grasshopper?</p>
<p>This grasshopper, I mean—<br>
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,<br>
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,<br>
who is moving her jaws back and forth<br>
instead of up and down—<br>
who is gazing around<br>
with her enormous and complicated eyes.</p>
<p>Now she lifts her pale forearms<br>
and thoroughly washes her face.<br>
Now she snaps her wings open,<br>
and floats away.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
I do know how to pay attention,<br>
how to fall down<br>
into the grass,<br>
how to kneel down in the grass,<br>
how to be idle and blessed,<br>
how to stroll through the fields,<br>
which is what I have been doing all day.</p>
<p>Tell me, what else should I have done?<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t everything die at last, and too soon?</p>
<p>Tell me, what is it you plan to do<br>
with your one wild and precious life?</p>

<li><strong>Kalā (कला)</strong> refers to a specialized skill, art, or science a cultivated capacity that blends practical technique, aesthetic sensibility, and deeper philosophical grounding.</li>
<li>Traditionally, the 64 Kalās are considered a comprehensive set of human accomplishments - spanning arts, crafts, sciences, and life skills - aimed at holistic development.</li>
<li>Never seen as <strong>&ldquo;hobbies&rdquo;</strong> but as integral parts of education, contributing to a balanced personality physical, intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual.</li>
<li><strong>Interconnected:</strong> Many Kalās integrate Ganita Vidyā, āyurveda, music theory, vāstu, and philosophy.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>At this age, skills are given in seed form — not as formal training but through play, rhythm, imitation, and imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teacher/parent’s role is to model beauty, order, joy → the child “absorbs” the Kalās naturally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many Kalās that in Indian tradition appear as refined arts (music, crafts, riddles) are given through playful, child-suitable forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can includes some things as long term practice, some things as one of exposures. For example we can include art, hand work, music, drama in schedule as long term practice. Weaving cloth kind of thing as one of learning experience / project theme.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measure the walls.<br>
Count the ribs.<br>
Notch the long days.</p>
<p>Look up for blue sky through the spout.<br>
Make small fires with the broken hulls of fishing boats.<br>
Practice smoke signals.</p>
<p>Call old friends,<br>
and listen for echoes of distant voices.</p>
<p>Organize your calendar.<br>
Dream of the beach.<br>
Look each way for the dim glow of light.</p>
<p>Work on your reports.<br>
Review each of your life’s ten million choices.</p>
<p>Endure moments of self-loathing.<br>
Find the evidence of those before you.<br>
Destroy it.</p>
<p>Try to be very quiet,<br>
and listen for the sound of gears and moving water.<br>
Listen for the sound of your heart.</p>
<p>Be thankful that you are here,<br>
swallowed with all hope,<br>
where you can rest and wait.</p>
<p>Be nostalgic.<br>
Think of all the things you did<br>
and could have done.</p>
<p>Remember treading water<br>
in the center of the still night sea,<br>
your toes pointing again and again<br>
down,<br>
down into the black depths.</p></blockquote>

<p>મોરલા હો ! મુંને થોડી ઘડી
તારો આપ અષાઢીલો કંઠ :
ખોવાયેલી વાદળીને હું
છેલ્લી વાર સાદ પાડી લઉં.</p>
<p>ઇંન્દ્રધનુષ ! તારા રંગ-ધોધોમાંથી
એક માગું લીલું બુન્દ :
સાંભરતાંને આંકવા કાજે
પીંછી મારી બોળવા દેજે !</p>
<p>મેઘમાલા ! તારા લાખ તારોમાંથી
ખેંચવા દે એક તાર :
બેસાડીને સૂર બાકીના
પાછી સોંપી દૈશ હું વીણા.</p>
<p>ઘોર સિંધુ ! તારા વીંજણાનું નાનું
આપજે એક કલ્લોક :
હૈયું એક નીંદવિહોણું –
ભાલે એને વાયરો ઢોળું.</p>
<p>રાતરાણી ! તારા ઝાકઝમાળાનું
મારે નથી કાંઇ કામ :
ગાઢ અંધકાર – પછેડા
ઓઢાડી દે ઊંઘની વેળા.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;version-1---simple-&#34;&gt;Version 1 - simple :&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our true nature is a state of inner joy, peace, clarity, and connection — where we feel light, open, and deeply at home in ourselves and with the world. A person living from this true nature acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, we are not able to live in this space every moment because our mind gets clouded by avidyā — ignorance of who we really are — which shows up as old habits, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that cover our inner light. Vidyā, or true knowledge, is the process of clearing these clouds so the sun of our real self can shine naturally. To do this, we walk paths that engage the whole being through the Panchakosha framework: yoga practices to align body, breath, and mind; the 64 kalās to refine our senses, skills, and creativity; and Rasa theory to understand and harmonize our emotions. Together, these tools help children and adults alike live more and more from their true nature, moment to moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Our true nature is a state of inner joy, peace, clarity, and connection — where we feel light, open, and deeply at home in ourselves and with the world. A person living from this true nature acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, we are not able to live in this space every moment because our mind gets clouded by avidyā — ignorance of who we really are — which shows up as old habits, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that cover our inner light. Vidyā, or true knowledge, is the process of clearing these clouds so the sun of our real self can shine naturally. To do this, we walk paths that engage the whole being through the Panchakosha framework: yoga practices to align body, breath, and mind; the 64 kalās to refine our senses, skills, and creativity; and Rasa theory to understand and harmonize our emotions. Together, these tools help children and adults alike live more and more from their true nature, moment to moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-2-">Version 2 :</h2>
<p>Our Ātman — the innermost Self — is identical with Brahman, the infinite reality. In its pure state, it is sat–chit–ānanda: existence, consciousness, and bliss. Living in awareness of this Self feels like natural joy, peace, clarity, and connection — a sense of being fully at home in oneself and in harmony with the universe. One who abides in this realization acts with compassion, wisdom, and balance, responding to life from presence rather than reacting from fear or habit. Yet, this abiding awareness is often veiled by avidyā — ignorance of our true identity as Ātman–Brahman — manifesting as old patterns, emotions, beliefs, and conditioning that obscure our inner light. Vidyā, or liberating knowledge, is the process of removing these coverings so the radiance of the Self shines unobstructed.</p>
<p>For children aged 3–8, education can nurture this natural awareness by protecting their curiosity, guiding their emotions, and helping them explore the world with wonder rather than fear. Through the Panchakosha framework, yoga can help them develop body–mind awareness and calm breathing; the 64 kalās can be introduced as age-appropriate creative arts and life skills to refine senses and expression; and Rasa theory can guide activities that help them recognize, name, and balance emotions. In this way, early learning does not just transfer information but cultivates a child’s wholeness — allowing them to grow without losing touch with their true Self, so that the seed of Ātman–Brahman awareness can flourish throughout life.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>My takeaway :</strong> The role of aesthetics in Indian thought is to evoke rasa — the emotional essence that touches the heart deeply. This rasa becomes a gateway to self-awareness, inviting you to notice what is happening inside you as you watch, listen, or experience something.</p>
<p>When you are able to give full attention to that inner movement, viveka (discernment) or prajñā (wisdom) begins to awaken. From this awakening, your actions can emerge from a dhārmik space — not just in a moral or religious sense, but in alignment with inner truth, right relationship, and the greater harmony of life.</p>
<p>To live dhārmikly, then, is to stay close to what is alive within you. In this, art and aesthetics become tools of inner refinement. They make you sensitive — not only to the outer world, but also to the subtle stirrings of your own being</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Abhinavagupta:</strong> who saw rasa as a pathway to śānta rasa (peace), the highest aesthetic and spiritual state.</p>
<p><strong>Tagore:</strong> who wrote about sahaj saundarya — a spontaneous aesthetic that brings inner harmony.</p>
<p><strong>Anand Coomaraswamy:</strong> who said, “The artist is not a special kind of man, but every man is a special kind of artist when he is in tune with his own dharma.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="inspiration-is-a-beautiful-cycle">Inspiration is a Beautiful Cycle</h3>
<p>Note by Janantik Shukla</p>
<hr>
<p>101: 3-Day Mobile Filmmaking Workshop with Sakha Fellows at Vadodara and Nareshwar.</p>
<p>Inspiration is a beautiful cycle for any artist. When we inspire the younger generation, they return the favor with their fresh energy, new stories, and poetry. In the process, we find ourselves traveling back to our own younger days.</p>
<p>Personally, after spending time with the students during this workshop, I felt recharged—ready to face clients, making pitch, the frustration of delayed payments, and the rejections that come with keep creating and capturing beautiful stories on screen.</p>
<p>During the three-day workshop, we explored theatre, visual storytelling, and memory exercises. We also screened a range of short films and a feature. As part of a storytelling exercise, the students initially came up with a web series idea that couldn’t be filmed in just half a day. So they pivoted and developed four new stories—all centered around the river.</p>
<p>Out of those four, they managed to shoot and edit two films. While the films are still in the first-cut stage, I’ll share them once they’re ready.</p>
<p>Super proud of the Sakha Fellows!</p>
<p>Thanks Mihir Pathak for wonderful opportunity.</p>

<p>Note by Mihir Pathak</p>
<p>We set out to explore our river — its deep connection with life, its biodiversity, and the rich socio-cultural stories that flow alongside it.</p>
<p>Taking baby steps, we began this journey through the powerful medium of film making. With the amazing Janantik Shukla guiding us, we discovered new ways of seeing and storytelling.</p>
<p>Film Making Workshop | 23rd to 25th May 2025</p>
<hr>
<p>Note by Suraj Kori</p>
<p>The Sakha Fellowship volunteer group successfully hosted an inspiring 3-day Filmmaking Workshop, engaging 25 enthusiastic students from high school and college. Led by Janantik Shukla, the workshop began with an exciting day in Vadodara, followed by a two-day residential camp near the serene Narmada River.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our incredible mentors - Ashish Bhangaokar, Rameshwari Gajjar, and Mihir Pathak - whose guidance made this journey truly transformative.</p>
<p>From scripting and shooting to editing and storytelling, the workshop was a perfect blend of learning and fun, sparking creativity and collaboration among all participants.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who made this experience unforgettable!</p>

<p>Tantra is not black magic :)</p>
<h3 id="principles-of-tantra-">Principles of tantra :</h3>
<ul>
<li>પૃથ્વી પરના જીવન - રંગ, રસ , રૂપ માં જે આનંદ લે છે.. ઉત્સવ બનાવે છે.</li>
<li>જીવનને સમગ્રતા થી સ્વીકાર કરે છે. ઉજાસ ને સ્વીકારે છે.</li>
<li>તંત્ર ડેમોક્રેટિક છે. બધાનો સ્વીકાર છે. જાતિ, જેન્ડર, ધર્મ, અમીર - ગરીબ</li>
<li>વિઘ્નો સાધન છે. યાત્રા સાધ્ય છે. વિઘ્નો સાધના નો ભાગ છે. વિઘ્નો તમને વધુ મજબૂત બનાવે છે.</li>
<li>આ ક્રિયા યોગ છે. અશક્તિ વિનાનો આનંદ છે. આનંદ માટે નીકળ્યા હોય ત્યારે નામ ન પૂછો. જીવનમાં સમગ્રતા થી ભાગ લે.</li>
<li>પળની અંદર સંગ્રતા થી ભાગ લે અને પળને શાશ્વતી બનાવી લે. Live the moment, it will give you sense of eternity.</li>
<li>ઇન્દ્રિયો પારનો રસ્તો ઇન્દ્રિયો માં થઈ ને જાય છે. પરમ નો રસ્તો નગર માં થઈ ને જાય છે. જે માણસ નદી ઓળંગે અને ભીંજાય નહીં એનો કોઈ અર્થ નહીં. હું ભીંજાવ, છોળો ઉછાળતો જાવ..</li>
<li>અસલામતી માં જીવન પાંગરે છે. જીવન ખાતર જુગાર છે. તક મળે તો જુગાર રમી લેવાનો.</li>
<li>જેને શ્રેષ્ઠ જીવવું છે એને શ્રેષ્ઠ દાવ પર પણ મૂકવું પડે છે.</li>
<li>પતન એ ઉત્થાનનો જ ભાગ છે. ભટકવું, ખોવાઈ જવું એ બધું જ.. અંધકાર એ ઉજાસનો જ ભાગ છે.</li>
<li>સ્થૂળ માંથી પસાર થયા વગર સૂક્ષ્મ પમાતુ નથી. જેને દેહનો પ્રેમ નથી કર્યો એ મનના સ્તરે શુ જશે, જે મનના સ્તરે નથી ગયો એ આત્માના સ્તરે શુ જશે.</li>
<li>પૃથ્વીનો સંપર્ક છૂટી જાય એ વૃક્ષ ફળ નથી આપતું. જીવન સાથેનો સંપર્ક અચૂક રાખવો. ચૈતન્યનું લક્ષણ વિસ્તાર છે.</li>
<li>જીવનમાં જે સર્જાય છે.. સંગીત, ચિત્ર, બધાને બે હાથ પહોળા કરીને આવકાર.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tantra-in-day-to-day-life">Tantra in day to day life</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>વધુ ઇન્દ્રિયમય બનો. ઇન્દ્રિયોને ધિક્કારો નહિ. Trust your senses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>મનને પડતું મુકો. આપણને દરેક ક્ષણે મનની જરૂરી નથી. &lsquo;મન મૂકીને ને નાચો&rsquo; When you experience anything with senses live it thoroughly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>અપરાધ ભાવ છોડી દેવાની જરૂર છે. કેટલાક લોકો આંનદ ને જ અપરાધ ગણે છે. દમન ને જવાદો. અપરાધ ભાવ છૂટી જશે તો મનની પકડ ઢીલી થઈ જશે.
leave this : this is good , that is bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જીવનને અભિવ્યક્તિ આપવાની જરૂર છે. મુક્ત રીતે અભિવ્યક્ત કરો. આનંદ જ જીવનનું સાધ્ય, સાધન અને સાધના છે. ત્યાગ વૈરાગ એ પરમ તત્વ નથી. પરમ તત્વ તો રસરાજ છે , રંગ રાજ છે, નટરાજ છે
વિનોબા : એક ઉંમર માં આનંદ પ્રાપ્તિ ધ્યેય હોય છે. પછી આનંદ ની પરિશુધ્ધ ધ્યેય બને. કામ - પ્રેમ - ધ્યાન - પ્રકાશ</p>
</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was tagged by Thejesh on &lt;a href=&#34;https://thejeshgn.com/2025/02/27/a-challenge-of-blog-questions/&#34;&gt;a series of questions that he had answered about blogging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am so happy to be back in blogosphere.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was tagged by Thejesh on <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/2025/02/27/a-challenge-of-blog-questions/">a series of questions that he had answered about blogging</a>.</p>
<p>I am so happy to be back in blogosphere. I have discovered many interesting people through Thej&rsquo;s weekly notes &amp; blogring. I am also trying to contact them to know more about their work and interesting projects they are doing. Thank you Thej.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>I started blogging long back in 2012. At that time it was a fascination to understand the technology, while using wordpress it was &rsquo;need of connect with new people&rsquo; (I was 17yr old exploring / figuring my career - studies - life ).</p>
<p><strong>current &lsquo;Why&rsquo; :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documenting and sharing my work and life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Till a year ago I was mostly blogging in Gujarati language. Now I am blogging in English so I can connect and share with more people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through weekly notes I try to document updates about what is happening in my life. What am I reading, watching, learning, doing, my side projects. I don&rsquo;t share much about my full time work / organization. I tried sharing about previous org, but they somehow read it and HR called me and asked to delete the post. I can not mention in my weekly notes about what is happening in my project or team. Fair enough, so now I write about it in private note and talk more about my side projects. For me working in education / with children is not like a job. It is like a way of my life, an integral part of my life so I want to document - talk - share about everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to write a blog post category called &lsquo;Update&rsquo; in my previous blog but after reading Thej&rsquo;s weekly notes, last year I have started writing in &lsquo;weekly note&rsquo; format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from weekly notes, I have three major blog post categories :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Filed notes :</strong> (learning experience with children / notes from session / classroom / workshop / facilitation)</li>
<li><strong>Learning resources :</strong> (research papers, videos, any kind of material related to education, child development, PBL, Experiential learning and other interest areas)</li>
<li><strong>Other :</strong> opinion / short note / comments about technology / education / philosophy / anything</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I also host my published articles, creative writing and my portfolio of work on the same site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?</strong></p>
<p>I have used many different platforms: blogspot, wordpress, php site, medium, used instagram for blogging..<a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/my-blogging-journey/">Here you can read my blogging journey</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I am using the Hugo site hosted on github pages.</p>
<p>I have realized that my site is going to be image heavy and github is not suitable for that. There is limit to host your site on GH Pages. Since the last few days I have been trying to figure out the feature proof solution for the same. Friends suggested different options : go for CDN &amp; Image storing on cloudinary / S3 , Ghost, Blot, self host on pi, build hugo site in local machine and host public folder on VM.</p>
<p>I want a solution where I can put all my data in one place (not like images in different place and text files are in different place). I don&rsquo;t want to lock in, I want to control my own data. I am also ready to pay 3-4k annually.</p>
<p>I am convinced to go for the last option. Let&rsquo;s see when I get a chance to set up and how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?</strong></p>
<p>I write all my posts, edit my pages on sublime text. Friends suggested VS Code but I am still in love with sublime.</p>
<p><strong>Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly I publish immediately. Sometimes I make drafts of weekly notes, add to it throughout the week and write the final version during Friday / weekend. Sometimes I use a paper journal to note down points.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favorite post on your blog?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/i-never-bought-a-new-laptop/">I never bought a new laptop</a></li>
</ul>
<p>From my Gujarati blog :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/p/5a5a882f792a">સંવેદનશીલતાના પ્રેમની કેળવણી</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/p/1779a6248277">facilitation બોલે તો ?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I am planning to shift my blog on S3 kind of server. So I can publish more images without worrying about github limits.</p>
<p>Apart from that I need to make a workflow where :</p>
<ul>
<li>When I do a session with children, Write a post + publish photos in the &lsquo;field notes&rsquo; category. Put that link in a page called documentation with date and meta data. Duplicate that on linkedin + Instagram</li>
<li>Maintain &lsquo;Now&rsquo; page + archive, add side projects in documentation page. Make documentation page as master archive page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who’s next?</strong></p>
<p>I am tagging <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik Mistry</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="summary-of-todays-session">Summary of Today’s Session</h2>
<h3 id="we-are-not-very-different-from-other-species">We are not very different from other species.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fungi do trading, we do too.</li>
<li>Animals hunt and gather, and so do we.</li>
<li>Animals signal for mating and choose the best partner to carry their genes forward. We do that too.</li>
<li>Animals compete, and we do the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our body and brain perceive only a small part of reality, just like the example of a Herring Gull bird focusing on a red dot. We too often see just the &ldquo;red dot&rdquo; in many situations. This is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We watch Bollywood movies (which mostly contain violence and romance).</li>
<li>We eat junk food (caught in the dopamine loop).</li>
<li>We get alarmed when politicians say another community will destroy our existence – we get triggered.</li>
<li>We know we can make healthy food at home, but we still order from outside.</li>
<li>We get influenced by &ldquo;artificial needs,&rdquo; like the idea that we need to buy certain brands to look cool. These aren’t real needs; they’re socially constructed to benefit companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-can-we-do-about-this">What can we do about this?</h3>
<p>Signals from our DNA aren’t always good for us. Take surgery, for example. When you undergo surgery, your brain signals pain because it perceives it as a threat. But we use anesthesia to stop the pain and perform surgery for a better future.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes we need to ignore signals from our genes and think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I really need this?</li>
<li>Do I really need to compete?</li>
<li>Is there really a scarcity, or do we have enough?</li>
<li>Should I accept everything that comes from the past or tradition without questioning it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our DNA might tell us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy more</li>
<li>Fight because they’re &ldquo;destroying&rdquo; us</li>
<li>Earn more because we’re not safe</li>
</ul>
<p>But we need to ask: Really?</p>
<h3 id="our-nature-can-also-help-us-grow">Our Nature Can Also Help Us Grow</h3>
<p>For example, curiosity, learning, and creation are part of our nature. So, let’s use that to create things that solve real-world problems. This will give us both money and fulfillment.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Money isn’t inherently bad. It’s a system, a mutually agreed-upon concept made by humans to run society. However, like any complex system, it has its flaws.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-money-status-and-people-connected">Why are Money, Status, and People Connected?</h3>
<p>Biologically, having more resources means more safety and freedom. Since money provides resources, people tend to respect and give status to those who have it. But this is like focusing only on the red dot – we shouldn’t judge people or choices based solely on money. There are many other factors to consider.</p>
<p>Whether you’re choosing a partner or a career, looking only at money, fame, or status might lead to a downfall. So, think about other aspects too.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="we-give-irrational-value-to-many-things-and-chase-after-them">We Give Irrational Value to Many Things and Chase After Them</h2>
<p>We place irrational value on luxurious bikes, cars, watches, phones, and houses. They become status symbols, and people work hard just to achieve these symbols. This is completely irrational.</p>
<p>But we can change our status symbols. Imagine if these were society’s new status symbols:</p>
<h3 id="signs-of-a-healthy-wealthy-and-wise-society">Signs of a Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise Society</h3>
<p><em>(Shared by Manish Jain, inspired by Bhutan’s GNH)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Walking and bicycling are the primary modes of transport.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes (at least 10 different species) can walk freely in neighborhoods, feeling safe and respected.</li>
<li>Every neighborhood has at least 100 diverse plant and tree species, including organic fruits, wild foods, and medicinal plants, and the soil is rich with microorganisms.</li>
<li>People spend at least one hour a day drinking herbal tea with friends.</li>
<li>Fresh bread is made and eaten daily using freshly ground flour, often two to three times per day.</li>
<li>Men feel comfortable crying in front of others and are encouraged to share their feelings openly. Daily human touch is encouraged.</li>
<li>There’s no need for excessive security measures like CCTV, security guards, barbed wire fencing, or high military spending. People don’t have to lock their doors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-your-indicators-of-happiness">What Are Your Indicators of Happiness?</h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-society">What Makes a Good Society?</h2>
<p>A good society is where everyone feels respected and has the opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Today, on Republic Day, let’s take a pause…</p>
<p>The five basic constitutional values of India, as outlined in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Justice</strong> – Social, economic, and political justice for all citizens, ensuring fairness and equality in society.</li>
<li><strong>Liberty</strong> – Freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, protecting individual rights and personal freedoms.</li>
<li><strong>Equality</strong> – Equal status and opportunity for all, ensuring that everyone is treated without discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.</li>
<li><strong>Fraternity</strong> – Promoting a sense of brotherhood and unity among citizens, ensuring dignity for the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.</li>
<li><strong>Secularism</strong> – Ensuring that the state treats all religions equally and does not promote or favor any particular religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>These values form the foundation of India&rsquo;s democratic and inclusive system, ensuring the rights and freedoms of its citizens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assignment-for-everyone">Assignment for Everyone</h2>
<p>Think about these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is there such a difference in the salaries of a farmer and a software engineer? Both work hard, right?</li>
<li>What would happen if we gave the same salary to every profession?</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a short note about these two questions and share it with us within the next 10 days.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out to us if you want to discuss anything.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &amp;lsquo;Marriage&amp;rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.. but still I will try to put what ever is coming in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &lsquo;Marriage&rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.. but still I will try to put what ever is coming in the flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Feb 2024 we did <a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/LZQcbKVxaVXu1iZ9SvLeau2F">&lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo;</a> exhibition. It was a culmination of 3 -4 month long journey with Imapana (student from BeMe school). I am very grateful to BeMe for giving me this space to experiment like this. It was long time wish to do this type of work with children. I am planning to write article on pedagogical aspect of this experiment.</p>

<p>In Feb I have visited Chennai beach to see turtle nesting with Harshit (student from BeMe). <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">It was very new experience for me</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I met many inspiring &amp; intersting people this year - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C21GbryIQ97/?img_index=1">Jane Sahi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">Arun V</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C51RvfvoGYh/?img_index=1">Anand Chitipothu</a>, <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/">Paras Chopra</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wowsig/?hl=en">Aakansha Gaur</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C59-MIZIeKj/">Nature Classroom team</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C14ocvOIbaO/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">ATREE Water workshop</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2gbwwFItFS/?img_index=1">Sci Gallary BLR taeam</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6Dvv9yoMh1/">Anish &amp; Junuka</a></p>

<h3 id="moving-back-to-vadodara">Moving back to Vadodara</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Left bangalore and moved to Vadodra : I shifted to BLR on Dec 2022 to join BeMe and spend more time with Nidhi (She was studying in Azim Premji University that time). After finishing MA in education at APU, Nidhi took job at org called ThinkTac - Science education company. She didn&rsquo;t liked the nature of work. It was more working in content development side rather than facilitation / working with children or teacher. She was more interested in facilitation that time. She left the job in 4 months (Jun 2023 - Sep 2023). She took break of 7 months (Oct 2023 - Apr 2024 ) during the break she did small projects like helping me in setting up the time exhibition, book translation for nature classroom, etc.</p>
<p>After one point we both felt that we need to move somewhere else to work. Because joing BeMe was not the option for her that time. If she gets the job somewhere in BLR, everything is very far and expensive. I never wanted to leave BeMe. It was my dream job. But nothing was working out.</p>
<p>We tried shifting to Pune. I got the job at Anubhuti learning center. Similar alternative space like beme. But Nidhi was not getting appropriate job. So we canceled the option.</p>
<p>During that time parents were encouraging me to come back to vadodra, they were feeling lonely, their health were not ok, we wanted to be around them so we can take our marriage conversation forward. So we decided that let&rsquo;s go back to vadodara.</p>
<p>Some how it worked out. I had a talk with Ravi bhai and he offered 1 year grant. I got job as content developer at Pratham Foundation.
Aaakansha also offered 1 year - Escape Velosity Grant to us. So with all of support, we came to Vadodra on 30th April 2024.</p>
<p>Nidhi also got <a href="https://bhoomicollege.org/teach-for-nature-fellowship-fellows">&lsquo;Teach for Nature Fellowship&rsquo;</a> to work in Nature Education in Vadodara.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement---mihir--nidhi">Engagement - Mihir &amp; Nidhi</h3>
<ul>
<li>First thing we did after moving back was event of our formal engagement with friends and family members. It was tough.
10 people coming from Kanpur in train staying in small town like padra, managing whole event, managing everyone&rsquo;s ego - emotions - expectations.. it was tough for me and nidhi both. But we did it. We came out of our comfort zone and did it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiest moment was when our friends came to the event and stood with us.</p>

<h3 id="work-at-pratham">Work at Pratham</h3>
<p>Pratham was roller coaster experience. In the beginning I was very happy that I got remote job so I can stay in vadodra and also do other work. Secondly it was content development job in environment domain. My team was producing videos for topics like climate change, plastic literacy and more. There was interesting project called creativity club in our account too. Where we need to develop prompt videos for children age 10+ yrs to foster their creativity, collaboration, communication and problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Overall work was interesting but I could sustain there for more than 7 months.</p>
<p>Few reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was remote team with large scale, deadline driven project. Working in high peace environment with remote team was new experience for me. I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to team and the factory approach which we were using for content development. I felt very disconnected from ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my skills were not very good for this type of work environment. I mostly worked with children or teachers. On ground. Never worked with canva - excel - chatgpt. So it was good learning.</p>
<p>I first time wrote script for videos
I first time made posters &amp; videos on canva
I was part of team of the project at this scale for first time where my content goes to thousands of children pan India.</p>
<p>I learnt how to make content for creativity and other 21st century skills. Mainly we were using design thinking activities, replicating already available activities in our format. But making it useful for large scale project is also good learning.</p>
<p>I learnt about how large scale orgs works, I learnt little bit about partnerships and funding</p>
<p>best part of my work was coordinating with nature educators from all over India to nature education camps with children at different location. It was good that I already had network of people in the domain.</p>
<p>I left pratham on 15th Nov 2024. Took few days back break and joined <a href="https://projectdefy.org/">Project DEFY</a> (25th Nov 2024) as subject matter expert - self directed learning. It&rsquo;s 3 months remote assignment.</p>
<p>during pratham days I first time experienced serious anxiety. Stress. Somehow it was very chill for other team members. But I was not handle constant stress, constant communication &amp; coordination.. it was very bad phase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-work--expectations-from-home">Finding Work &amp; expectations from home</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aakansha and Ravi bhai offered the grant for the one year. I left the pratham so now we didn&rsquo;t have any backup for money.
most of the pratham&rsquo;s salary is going to be used in marriage event (all the shopping, jewellery and all). Nidhi has some money coming through fellowship but that also she was not able to continue because multiple things going on at home. so we reached out to all social media, all the friends with the <a href="https://learningwala.in/ourneeds/">request</a>. we got many calls from alternative schools from south, many orgs, individuals.</p>
<p>we are very very grateful to all the people who reached out to us with offerings. People who connected us with other people, people who thought about us.</p>
<p>Because of my family situation we need to stay near to vadodra / ahemdabad. My parents wants us to stay near to them. Because of their loneliness, because of their health, because their insecurities , because they feel socially confident when we are around.. for whatever reasons they are not happy about we leaving vadodra and go far from them.</p>
<p>one more aspect to it is they want Nidhi to be house wife kind of person. Helping my mother to do all the work, not taking independent work. My home is based in Patriarchy system. so to stay far from it we need to find work-stay option where we are not very near to them and not very far.</p>
<p>This year very big chunk of my time went to fight and manage the balance of our values and expectations from family. Friends helped me a lot in this. thank you rameshwari ben, mitali ben, many other friends.</p>
<p>Now we are stuck, we have very limited option at vadodra / ahemdabad for meaningful and well paid work. After eliminating many options right now we left with very few :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :</strong> Ravi bhai is willing to continue grant next year also, Aakansha also offered that if I can help her in some admin work of &rsquo;escape velocity grant&rsquo; she can offer grant for one more year. With this assurance we can move to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school 2hrs far from vadodra and work there. Next year we can again search for grant. (Inlaks Grants, The Circle incubation) Also we can find out some part time / remote work if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> we can work directly with children, we can develop nature education curriculum / do action reasecrh. Nidhi and me can work on our health, we can also be near to my family. We can also work with other orgs in Vadodra because it is just 2hrs away.</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> Instability of funding, we might feel lonely sometime in village.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gopaldham learning center :</strong> it is an Ashramshala in Jashdan near rajkot / chotila. 5hrs from vadodra. they are looking for school leader kind of person.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> there are only 70 children, we will get full freedom to do meaningful work. We both will get work. Good payment also</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> this is new place. We don&rsquo;t know the founders and team personally. No friends, we will feel lonely. We need to leave work we have started in vadodra</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Balgokulam :</strong> it is an early childhood research org based in ahemdabad.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro :</strong> good salary. My role will direct working with children and researching about early childhood curriculum. so new learning opportunity. we can come to vadodara when ever is needed, it is just 2hrs</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> new set up don&rsquo;t know what exactly my role looks like. It is new org started in 2023 so don&rsquo;t know the future. We will need to find job for nidhi.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Eklavya, Bhopal :</strong> with Aakansha&rsquo;s funding we can go eklavya bhopal and start working there with libraries. I am not sure that ravi bhai will give funding for that.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> Eklavya family will be there, lots of new people, friends, projects</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> instability of funding. We need to leave our work which we started in vadodra. We might not get access to children like school. Because we will work with libraries.</p>
<p>I am eliminating BLR right now but we have shortlisted some org if we want to go : creative school, beme, project DEFY, seed to sapling, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me &amp; Nidhi both went to Nephropathy this year at Nisargupchar Kendra - Gotri, Vadodra. It is wonderful place.
I am suffering from stomach problems and Nidhi is suffering from skin - hair issues. (apart from our mental health) We tried following the diet for month or two.. it was magical.. it works. eating millets and doing yoga. After one point of time it got difficult for us to manage the routine and making food at home. but we want to start it again when we get new place to stay and work. This year I want to start doing regular exercise &amp; eating healthy food. (This very basic and obvious thing but very hard to do )</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golu">Golu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s brother Tanishk aka golu was also there with us in Vadodra for few months. Nidhi invited him to take break after his 12th exam and explore options other than joining privet engineering collage. It was mistake&hellip; we were not ready. it was difficult to make some one self directed learner in short time. Also against his will. It was good learning for us to see what is happening inside us when situation like this come on our face. what happens inside us? , can we empathize ? it was tough time for me personally.</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t find meaning in this type of exploration time, he became phone - game addict, he bought new iphone and it was game changer for him&hellip; in short some mistake from our side, some expectation from his side.. it didn&rsquo;t work out. I was so happy when he went back home. I was genuinely concerned and still I am concerned about his future. I never thought bad about him but our expectation didn&rsquo;t match. We were super busy in our work we really didn&rsquo;t give proper time to him&hellip; it was wrong timing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our work got recognized : <a href="https://www.early-bird.in/meet-an-educator-mihir-pathak/">ebird - meet the educator article</a> - feeling proud.</li>
<li>I could manage to do local khoji event even with the stress and work load of pratham. I could have done better if I have time. I really didn&rsquo;t get time for the facilitating the project.</li>
<li>We (Nidhi, Mihir, Impana) managed to do &lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo; exhibition. I was on cloud 7 :)</li>
<li>This year I wrote regular <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a> on my website from week 12 to week 52 = 40 weeks = 10 months. I never thought that I will continue this habit. But I did. I am proud of it.</li>
<li>In first week of Dec I visited BLR to attend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDd2w5movCJ/?img_index=1">wipro partners</a> (my reflections) forum and meeting children at BeMe. Meeting children from 12+ group was a joy for me.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This year was very stressful and I felt serious anxiety many a times. Because of nature of work at Pratha,Home / family issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I first time tried fund raising. I pitched our work and managed to raised 9L rupees for a year from individual donors. I am very very grateful to them for trusting us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did session with corporate team for first time. Thank you Mitali ben for co- facilitating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I contributed / spent big amount of grant money and pratham&rsquo;s salary money for marriage prep, which I didn&rsquo;t like. I wanted to use that money for children or save it for future. Any way I am happy that we did camp from that money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year also I am part of Child Development and learning course at Eklavya. I co facilitated sessions this time. After the physical workshop we as team to need to be more active to respond the participant&rsquo;s need. But I felt that other team members are busy with other work and not able to give priority to this. It is frustrating for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year we (Nidhi and Mihir) took many workshops and sessions with different age groups. In 2025 we want to take up one project and do deeper work in that. We will take up the project of developing curriculum for Nature Detective program (age 3 to 11yrs) and for older age group we will work with children from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We will also plan to do action research kind of thing with Nature Classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took logistic responsibility for the residential camps we did this year. I invited Nidhi, Nishtha and Prerna for facilitation. It was a good experience for me. I learnt about my self that I enjoy doing this type of work also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sangha - tribe - community got stronger in mind this year. I learnt that if you want to walk on this path of alternatives you need strong sangha.. and you need to selflessly contribute in that sangha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year tested my and nidhi&rsquo;s bonding.. hard time.. stress.. things we hated came back to us&hellip;but we are strong &amp; together. Thank you so much Nidhi for being you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these years I was very confused about my offering in education. I am not a subject teacher, I am not a teacher trainer, I don&rsquo;t want to start NGO to scale things.. what exactly I want to do ? This year I got some answers :</p>

<h3 id="what-next-">What next ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work front : till 15th March 2025 - Project DEFY&rsquo;s work is there.</li>
<li>Need to figure out work after that. Gopaldham and Balgokulam people will reply in mid Jan. After that we will take a call. I am mostly inclined towards going to mitali ben&rsquo;s school for 1 year and then going back to BLR / stay back if we get regular funding. If we go to mitali ben&rsquo;s school, we will take up curriculum development project for nature detective and also collaborate with nature classroom for action research &amp; material development.</li>
<li>I want to continue work in vadodara. Specially with sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We (Rameshwari ben , Ashish bhai, Saurabh bhai, Nikita ben, Suraj, Mihir &amp; Nidhi) started one fellowship program for teenager. It&rsquo;s kind of swaraj university model / beme model / self directed learning / relationship model. It was a longest wish to do this type of work with youth. I am looking forward to that.</li>

<p>I am prying to universe to give me strength to manage my wedding event peacefully</p>
<p>After writing this much I still feel I missed something..but it&rsquo;s ok. I will update here if I remember something.
let&rsquo;s hope for the best. At this moment I just want to say thank you to Nidhi for always being with me in every situation. Thank you so much to all my friends and extended family.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a podcast from Scaler called ScalerPod. Where they interview CTOs from different startups. They ask about their journey, challenges and how their typical day looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Till now I have seen two episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)&#xA;Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Till now I have seen two episodes.</p>
<p>Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)
Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)</p>
<p>I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work.</p>
<p>He shared that intrinsic motivation for work comes from three things :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autonomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mastry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connectedness / Purpose</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here you go :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEZMSbeziEw&amp;t=870s">14:30</a> What motivates engineers?</p>
<p><strong>Full episode :</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain? People who have empty cars are offering seats to others. If we create such an app, car owners will know who else needs a ride.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was raining. I was traveling from Vadodara to Padra by local bus. In front of me, some college students were talking about their final year project ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If madam had let us leave earlier, we would have reached home sooner in this rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work on any project now. I gave such a great idea, but madam directly rejected it. Does that idea come in handy in such rain? People who have empty cars are offering seats to others. If we create such an app, car owners will know who else needs a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but these types of apps are already there, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m talking about a local app.
Another great idea was an app for men&rsquo;s customized clothes. But madam wouldn’t even listen to it. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also suggested a game idea, and she did the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s stop judging these students&rsquo; ideas and talk about their college teacher instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of listening to the students&rsquo; ideas and giving constructive feedback, she directly rejects them, saying it’s not possible.</li>
<li>She insults students in class in front of everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior crushes the self-esteem and confidence of the students. We need teachers who allow young people to share new ideas freely. When they receive support without fear, their creativity can flourish. Remember these young people are entrepreneur of tomorrow</p>

<p>Her teacher gave a task to explain some topics from the textbook in a hands-on manner.
This girl took the opportunity to introduce the wonder of nature to her classmates.</p>
<p>She made my day by sharing this.</p>
<p>This is the butterfly effect for me</p>
<p>If you provide a locally relevant direct experiences + provide safe space to flourish
Young people can do wonders.</p>
<p>Local khoji and many many other organization and initiatives working with youth, environment, citizenship - are BIG hope for me.</p>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What helped me?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What enables people to live a self - directed life ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?</li>
<li>What helped me?</li>
<li>What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?</li>
<li>What enables people to live a self - directed life ?</li>
</ul>
<p>if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people</p>
<p>to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness</p>
<p>think about the 16 year old boy or girl from small city like Vadodara, middle class family</p>
<ul>
<li>got typical education from school</li>
<li>no idea what career options / study options are available apart from typical sci, commerce and arts streams</li>
<li>no self confidence, very little self worth, no particular interests or ambition</li>
<li>easily get influenced by advertisements and media. No critical thinking lens</li>
</ul>
<p>In my journey what are the differentiators ?</p>
<p>the foundation is same but,</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to work on real life projects
I met people + spaces who don&rsquo;t judge, believe in you and give you the platform. Which ultimately become my tribe / community</p>
<p>How can I create this for friends and peers in Vadodara and my hometown Padra ?</p>
<p>Can project based learning become a starting point ?</p>
<p>Do one research / making / solving/entrepreneurship project around your city. Your questions, your ideas.</p>
<p>I will connect you with subject matter expert, will fund your project, will connect you with further opportunity  (internship / course / job / funding / learning)</p>
<p>This gives you non judgemental space, self confidence, you work in team, express yourself creatively and much more.</p>
<p>after the project done you becomes part of khoji community and keep doing interesting stuff</p>
<p>we will try to guide you for career opportunity, other learning opportunities</p>
<p>Local khoji is a distillation of ideas which I have been dreaming of for years.
Give unconventional, transformative learning experience to children.</p>
<p>This is not a CSR project / Not a NGO, it is just an initiative. I am very much open for collaboration
I am ready to share all my learnings / ideas / support  if you want to start local khoji at your town, your org, your school, your community. It can fit in your existing programs, curriculum and timetables.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been 11 years now working in the education sector. I worked with children age 3yrs to 18yrs. Schools from state board to IB boards. Homeschooling groups and alternative schools too..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for the last few years I got interested in working with teenagers or youth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How to give a platform to youth to thrive ?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How to give opportunities where they can build their agency&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how they can be self directed learner and foster life skills&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;how they engage in local environment and civic problems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are some of my goals when I say working with youth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been 11 years now working in the education sector. I worked with children age 3yrs to 18yrs. Schools from state board to IB boards. Homeschooling groups and alternative schools too..</p>
<p>for the last few years I got interested in working with teenagers or youth.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to give a platform to youth to thrive ?</li>
<li>How to give opportunities where they can build their agency</li>
<li>how they can be self directed learner and foster life skills</li>
<li>how they engage in local environment and civic problems</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of my goals when I say working with youth.</p>
<p>As a self -directed learner I saw that you need two very strong pillars to build your journey.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>non judgmental safe space + mentor/friend/peers who can challenge you, give reflective tools to you. Basically your tribe, who trust you, believe in you no matter how good you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure, Projects, Challenges, Things which helps you to shift your orbit
These are the two main things which I believe are game changers. I saw multiple organizations working on the same design.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to spend the next 10 years of my life on this problem. What will be my intervention design ?</p>
<ul>
<li>can we design a program where children can do real life project</li>
<li>where children can opportunity to think, work in team, find mentors and more</li>
</ul>
<p>What should be the context ? Theme ?</p>
<p>Can we give the local environment and civic as a theme ?
If you merge it all together :</p>
<p>Local khoji - a platform for children to conduct original and authentic inquiry projects about the cities they live in.</p>
<p>Children can different type of projects - research projects, making projects, story project rooted in place they live.</p>
<p>This will be a 3 to 4 month journey, according to how much time school / NGO / learning centers give to work on the project.</p>
<p>This program design is very much inspired by Solve Ninja (Reap Benefit) and City as lab - Mumbai (@cityaslabindia)</p>
<p>What happened after this intervention ? children who were involved in can start a club called ‘Khoji club’ which will become a incubator / Adda kind of place for children. There will be different events happening, reading - making - movie screening - talks and lots of fun.</p>
<p>I want to make the whole process open source so anybody can run local khoji and khoji clubs at their own place. And I want to focus on more innovative ideas. I don’t want to run as a typical NGO / org but more like a laboratory where I constantly work on ideas to re imagine learning.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/&#34;&gt;ASER ‘Byond Basics’&lt;/a&gt; report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do they have technology access / smart phone &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are their aspirations &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can they read and do basic maths &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I read the <a href="https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/">ASER ‘Byond Basics’</a> report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do they have technology access / smart phone </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are their aspirations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can they read and do basic maths </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smartphones are a great equlazirer but contentwise we are competing with youtube. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of content we should publish in this situation </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we ask youth what they want?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are you looking at learning happening outside the school ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These all are questions to the window of possibilities. I read the report and some other articles. I am writing some insights which I got reflecting on them. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to have dialgue with youth about what they want </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only creating content and putting it in the air will not work, we need to make the whole ecosystem of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can blame or expect schools to teach everything we need to look at the needs of this age group outside the school structure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to create informal learning spaces where young people can come, talk, and explore freely. (The youth wants a space to share their feelings, anxieties, and fears about the future.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second step can be nudging them for some learning - challenging activities where smartphones or technology can play a bigger role. But that one on one connect, guidance, mentorship is important </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take one scenario : </p>
<p>You started one youth program where young people join and teach children. Through this program you started one ‘youth adda’ where young people can come freely to talk - hangout. </p>
<p>Slowly you made genuine friendship with them, now they are open for your ideas and guidance.</p>
<p>You suggested they do one short course on ‘financial literacy’ so they can manage their finances well. Now high quilty content is important.</p>
<p>Youtube is winning because it is no brainer. You don’t need to think to see insta reels or youtube shots. You need brain, motivation and many other factors to see ‘learning content’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One way is, make your learning content in format of shots and influncere kind of videos. Like Vlogs and more. There are chances that you need to dilute your content to add those types of mirch masala.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second way is to build an ecosystem which encourages and nudges us to explore ‘learning content’ apart from those nobrainers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about Ankur wariku. He is making videos on financial literacy. Apart from making videos he is doing insta live with people to help them to learn ‘how to invest in their given salary’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He is building a community. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is taking subjects which very very relevant to young people </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we need to do both things in balance. We need to make our content more engaging and on the other side we need to build an ecosystem around it. </p>
<p>There are some more insights about vocational training and basic reading and maths </p>
<p>Which I will write some other time. </p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never bought new laptop in my life. I had P4 computer at home around 2008 - 9&#xA;After that when I dropped out of school and started working in different organisation, people helped me with their old laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first laptop was &lt;strong&gt;Asuse eee pc&lt;/strong&gt;.

<p>I remember going to Jigish Bhai&rsquo;s office and making live USB boot for openSUSE Linux distro. That was my first introduction to open source &amp; free software world. My mama Nirmal Pathak is fedora contributor. I remember reading Kartik Bhai&rsquo;s blog about debian &amp; Wikipedia. Doing wikipedia meetup at goraj muni seva ashram.</p>
<p>samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and world of developer :)</p>
<hr>
<p>When I went to dharampur few friends donated 2 - 3 laptops for our school.</p>
<ul>
<li>Toshiba - Vaibhav Pandya</li>
<li>Samsung - Jubin Mehta</li>
<li>Samsung (silver) - Shruti</li>
<li>ASUSE - chirag patel</li>
</ul>
<p>All the laptop were very old, their parts stopped working one by one (like screen, keyboard, battery, etc) accept Samsung (silver) one. When I went to Bhuj one visitor at our school gifted <strong>old macbook air 2013 model</strong>. It was in pretty good condition. I swapped samsung silver with that and started using it.</p>
<p>Since then I am using it as my primary machine. Writing, web browsing, teaching MIT Scratch to children, many other tinkering.. I changed the battery few months ago.</p>

<p>In 2021 Srishti gifted her old macbook air to me. I was using it with children on and off. When Nidhi needed laptop I gave it her. But unfortunately battery of that machine got swelled like balloon. It is difficult to open the body and change it.</p>
<p>Now I gave my macbook air to her and decided to buy new - refurbished laptop.</p>
<p>After some research 2 friends suggested to check out the work of Abhas Abhinav founder of Mostly harmless computers. He is FOSS enthusiast - activist - technologist - hardware hacker - geek. He runs a libretech.shop - a ethical source for libre and liberated hardware products.</p>
<p>I visited his office. It was nostalgia for me to dive in to the world of FOSS again. This time Nidhi was also there. I was happy to introduce her to this philosophy..</p>
<p><strong>Abhas bhai gifted me a book called &lsquo;code swaraj&rsquo; which is in my reading list.</strong></p>

<p>From his recommendation I met Ved who runs refurbished laptop shop in banaswadi.
After so much of comparing and testing I finally bought refurbished Thinkpad X1 Carbon 6th Gen (Intel i7 8th Gen, 16GB RAM, 512 HDD)</p>

<h3 id="my-criteria-was">My criteria was</h3>
<ul>
<li>repairablity</li>
<li>possiblity to upgrade (RAM, CPU)</li>
<li>portabilty (light weight)</li>
<li>feature proof</li>
<li>compatable with linux / free bios</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinkpad X1C is not true for all criteria. Number 1 yes, 2 no , 3 big yes, 4 yes, 5 yes - linux can run very nicely but the bios is not free you can&rsquo;t do core boot. You can&rsquo;t upgrade RAM. But solution I am thinking is after 5 - 6 years of usage I can again sell it to refurbished shop and upgrade the machine.</p>
<p>Tjesh GN, Aditya, Kartik bhai, Nirmal bhai and Suchakra helped a lot take the disison. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>So <strong>welcome to family - Thinkpad X1 Carbon - 2nd March 2024</strong></p>
<p>During this process I read a lot about FOSS and again visited <a href="kartikm.wordpress.com">Kartik bhai</a> &amp; <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">Thejesh&rsquo;s blog</a>. I amazed with the power of community in FOSS and really wish to see that in education sector.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started my first blog around 2012 from one cyber cafe. It was very fascinating for me at that time.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I can put something on the computer and the whole world can see. More than blogging it was about the whole website technology was fascinating for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to school I used to roam around different offices/ shops who make websites for small businesses. I visit them as customers and ask too many questions&amp;hellip; later on I did a market job with them in exchange for learning from their developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I started my first blog around 2012 from one cyber cafe. It was very fascinating for me at that time.<br>
I can put something on the computer and the whole world can see. More than blogging it was about the whole website technology was fascinating for me.</p>
<p>Instead of going to school I used to roam around different offices/ shops who make websites for small businesses. I visit them as customers and ask too many questions&hellip; later on I did a market job with them in exchange for learning from their developer.</p>
<p>I learn about static - dynamic websites, CMS (wordpress, Dhrupal, Jhoomla), some basics about HTML CSS and PHP, what is domain, what is hosting and server. And most importantly how to do business of developing websites - profit margins and other stuff.</p>
<p>My first blog/website was called &lsquo;<strong>Pathak Technologies</strong>&rsquo;. Small web development firm<br>
it was on <strong>blogger/blogspot.com</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Around 2013 I moved to wordpress. At that time there was a big Gujarati blogger community on wordpress. Most of them are sitting in the USA or Canada and blogging about their retired life :)<br>
I remember Suresh dada&rsquo;s blog, Vinod bhai blog&hellip;</p>
<p>I also remember reading <a href="https://hirals.wordpress.com/">Hiral ben</a>, <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik bhai</a>, <a href="https://nirmalpathak.wordpress.com/">Nirmal bhai&rsquo;s blogs</a>.</p>
<p>I was running three blogs at that time -</p>
<ul>
<li>my personal blog called &lsquo;<a href="https://mihirism.wordpress.com/">Mihirism</a>&rsquo;</li>
<li>blog called <a href="https://sureshbjani.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/laboratory/">&lsquo;Prayog Ghar&rsquo;</a> about science &amp; technology in simple language</li>
<li>&lsquo;<a href="https://kelavani.wordpress.com/">Sanistha kelavani</a>&rsquo; about Nai taleem education</li>
<li>I was contributing on &lsquo;<a href="http://evidyalay.net/">Evidyalay</a>&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>it was wonderful learning time</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p><img src="/blogging/medium.png" alt="Medium"></p>
<p>I remember samyak bhai introduced me to markdown, git and something called &lsquo;<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>&rsquo; :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Medium was very new and silk that time. super clean writing focused blogging platform.</strong></em></p>
<p>I liked it immediately and made <a href="https://medium.com/@learningwala">my profile</a>. <strong>My last post on Medium was on Nov- 2023</strong></p>
<p>I wrote about my classroom experiences / learning experiments with children and teachers, I wrote about some interesting resources I found for educators / interesting stuff around pedagogy and more. mostly centred around education, philosophy and pedagogy . Sometimes some personal stuff like poems or life as an educator..</p>
<p><strong>in between, around 2015</strong></p>
<p>we (<a href="https://www.lakhan.me/">lakhan samani</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kash9350">kashyap</a> helped me a lot. very grateful for that - Thank you guys) have made &rsquo;learnlabs&rsquo; website in PHP</p>
<p><strong>Around 2018</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://jubinsblog.com/">Jubin</a> introduced me to wix.com - I made first version on &rsquo;learningwala.com&rsquo; on that</p>
<p><strong>I was using it till 2022</strong></p>
<p>During that time I shifted my blogging journey on <a href="https://instagram.com/learningwala">instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly because I was getting community over there. Educators, Artist and more. I mostly put posts about my experiments with children, workshops I am conducting with teachers, books I am reading, inspiring educators and more.</p>
<p><strong>till now 839 posts, 1132 followers</strong></p>
<p>oh, I forgot about facebook. I have been active on FB since 2010 (Remember UC Browser ??) till I got instagram. After instagram, facebook is running on auto pilot. All instagram posts auto publish on FB.</p>
<p>I tried IFTTT before this instagram feature came.</p>
<ul>
<li>I made some very good connections through <a href="https://instagram.com/learningwala">instagram</a> and facebook.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>After leaving wix for my personal website I shifted my stuff (projects, writing, CV, etc) on <a href="https://linktr.ee/learningwala">linktree</a>.</p>
<p>I made websites for friends on wix and still maintain it.</p>
<p>Since the last few months I have had the desire to start my blogging journey again. With more categories in writing like weekly notes, ideas for project based learning / nature based learning and some other experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Medium is now paid for. You can&rsquo;t read unlimited stories.</strong> I started exploring other platforms<br>
Ghost, Wordpress, there is a long list of minimal blogging platforms. Some are giving self hosting facilities.</p>
<p>I was looking for a super minimal platform where I can just write posts and I have control on my data.<br>
no advertisement, monetisation of posts, no social network around blog, - just writing place</p>
<p>Someone suggested trying <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and Github pages. It was too geeky for me. I tried two - three themes but never started writing on it.</p>
<p>I found something called <a href="bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a></p>
<p>Basically, someone developed a back-end to update your static site. It is perfect for minimal blogging<br>
but it is not available for self hosting, what if this project got stopped ? What if the product strategy of this platform changes ?</p>
<p>But I really like the theme. I searched more and luckily I found the same theme on github which was available self hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> / <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> / your own server.</p>
<p>Finally I saw two youtube videos and learned how to set it. <strong>And yes I am writing on the same platform :)</strong></p>
<h2 id="low-tech-website">Low tech website</h2>
<p><em>This website too simple, ugly, no modern features</em></p>
<p>And no Js, No cookies, no tracker, fast, clean, functional, you own the data, you can develop in your own ways, less energy usage, less computing power usage</p>
<p><strong>let&rsquo;s find why, what and How about low tech website :</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-09-27/how-to-build-a-low-tech-website/">- How to Build a Low-tech Website?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lente.dev/en/posts/stone-websites/">- Stone websites</a></p>
<p><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">- This Page is Designed to Last</a></p>
<p><strong>My ultimate dream is to host my own static site on solar powered raspberry pi<br>
someday I will do it for sure.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
