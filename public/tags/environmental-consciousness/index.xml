      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of children sits in a circle.</p>
<p>I show them a picture of a man cutting a tree.</p>
<p>I ask a simple question:
<strong>“How do you feel when you look at this picture?”</strong></p>
<p>Hands go up.</p>
<p>One child says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t like it. We should not cut trees. Trees give us oxygen.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another adds,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is nice. We can make a table from the wood.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A third says thoughtfully,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we cut a big tree, we can get fruits easily from the top.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, I show another picture—
a man killing an ant by stepping on it.</p>
<p>Responses come quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It is bad. There is God inside the ant. We will be punished.”</li>
<li>“It is okay to kill the ant because I feel scared of ants.”</li>
</ul>
<p>As educators, moments like these often leave us uncertain.</p>
<p>Do we correct them?
Do we explain what is right and wrong?
Do we guide them toward “environmental values”?</p>
<p>Or… is something else needed here?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-work-with-the-affective-domain-at-this-age">Is it possible to work with the affective domain at this age?</h2>
<p>Yes—but only if we understand <strong>how children think and feel between 3–6 years</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this well, two frameworks are especially helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bloom’s affective domain</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-piaget-helps-us-see">What Piaget helps us see</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Jean Piaget</strong>, children aged 3–6 are in the <strong>preoperational stage</strong>.</p>
<p>At this stage, children:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think <strong>concretely</strong>, not abstractly</li>
<li>Learn through <strong>images, stories, and symbols</strong></li>
<li>Often repeat <strong>adult language</strong> without deep understanding</li>
<li>Experience the world primarily through <strong>their own feelings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So when children say:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Trees give oxygen”</li>
<li>“God will punish us”</li>
</ul>
<p>Piaget would not see this as ethical reasoning.</p>
<p>Instead, this is <strong>symbolic imitation</strong>—children borrowing words they have heard, not concepts they have reasoned through.</p>
<h3 id="what-piaget-does-not-say">What Piaget does <em>not</em> say</h3>
<p>Piaget does <em>not</em> say children cannot feel empathy or care.</p>
<p>He only reminds us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical moral reasoning is not yet possible</li>
<li>Abstract explanations will not land meaningfully</li>
</ul>
<p>This is crucial.</p>
<p>At this age:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethics cannot be taught</strong></li>
<li><strong>Affective experience is fully alive</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So if we stop trying to <em>teach values</em> and instead focus on <em>felt experience</em>, we are working developmentally correctly.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bloom-and-the-affective-domain">Bloom and the affective domain</h2>
<p>Bloom’s taxonomy is often used only for thinking skills, but Bloom also articulated a clear <strong>affective domain</strong>—which is central in early childhood.</p>
<h3 id="blooms-affective-levels-simplified">Bloom’s affective levels (simplified)</h3>
<p>For young children, the first three levels matter most:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Receiving</strong> – noticing, paying attention
(“I see a tree being cut”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responding</strong> – emotional reaction
(“I don’t like it”, “I feel scared”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Valuing (emerging)</strong> – showing preference or care
(“We should walk carefully”, “I like trees”)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Higher levels—organizing values or forming ethical systems—belong to later childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>So when children express fear, care, usefulness, or punishment, they are operating exactly where Bloom says they should be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-key-shift-for-educators">A key shift for educators</h2>
<p><strong>From judgement to noticing</strong></p>
<p>Instead of asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Is this right or wrong?”</li>
<li>“Should we do this or not?”</li>
</ul>
<p>We ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What do you notice is happening?”</li>
<li>“What do you think the tree or ant might be experiencing?”</li>
<li>“What happens inside your body when you see this?”</li>
</ul>
<p>This moves children away from borrowed morality and toward <strong>direct affective experience</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-work-with-such-moments-a-simple-process">How to work with such moments: a simple process</h2>
<h3 id="1-hold-all-responses-without-correction">1. Hold all responses without correction</h3>
<p>Fear, care, usefulness, punishment—<em>all are real experiences</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of correcting, mirror:</p>
<ul>
<li>“You’re feeling scared.”</li>
<li>“You’re thinking about using the tree.”</li>
<li>“You’re worried about punishment.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates <strong>affective safety</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-use-imagination-to-deepen-empathy">2. Use imagination to deepen empathy</h3>
<p>Young children enter the affective domain through <strong>imagination</strong>.</p>
<p>With the tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>“If the tree could talk, what might it say?”</li>
<li>“Who else lives on this tree?”</li>
</ul>
<p>With the ant:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Where was the ant going?”</li>
<li>“Does it live alone or with others?”</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no right answers. Silence is welcome.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-let-contradictions-coexist">3. Let contradictions coexist</h3>
<p>Some children feel fear.
Some feel care.
Some think about human needs.</p>
<p>Instead of resolving this, name it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Different feelings are present here.
More than one feeling can exist at the same time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This itself is deep affective learning.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-be-careful-with-abstractions">4. Be careful with abstractions</h3>
<p>Concepts like:</p>
<ul>
<li>oxygen</li>
<li>God</li>
<li>punishment</li>
</ul>
<p>often bypass lived experience.</p>
<p>Bring children back to the <strong>sensory and relational</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How does it feel to sit under a tree?”</li>
<li>“How would it feel if someone stepped on you?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Ethics grows from experience, not instruction.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-close-with-small-care-actions">5. Close with small care-actions</h3>
<p>Not moral conclusions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking carefully and watching the ground</li>
<li>Touching a tree gently</li>
<li>Observing ants without disturbing them</li>
</ul>
<p>This completes the affective loop:
<strong>feeling → relationship → action</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-this-work-isand-what-it-is-not">What this work is—and what it is not</h2>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching environmental morality</li>
<li>fixing children’s answers</li>
<li>forming values too early</li>
</ul>
<p>This <strong>is</strong> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>protecting the child’s capacity to feel</li>
<li>allowing empathy to arise naturally</li>
<li>laying the ground for later ethical understanding</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="in-essence">In essence</h2>
<p>Piaget reminds us of the <strong>limits of thinking</strong> in early childhood.
Bloom reminds us of the <strong>power of feeling</strong>.</p>
<p>Environmental consciousness in early childhood does not begin with rules or explanations.
It begins with <strong>attention, imagination, fear, care, and relationship</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Affective education is not about telling children what to value.
It is about keeping their ability to feel deeply alive.</strong></p></blockquote>
