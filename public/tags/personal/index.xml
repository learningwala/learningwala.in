      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is okay if I do not want to start my own NGO because I am afraid that I will not be able to raise funds, or because I am worried that my program will not align with traditional measurement tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is okay if I do not want to start &amp;lsquo;classes&amp;rsquo; or a learning center, or take paid workshops where I constantly market myself, where parents look at my practice as a product and themselves as customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>It is okay if I do not want to start &lsquo;classes&rsquo; or a learning center, or take paid workshops where I constantly market myself, where parents look at my practice as a product and themselves as customers.</p>
<p>It is okay if I do not belong to any specific subject or age group, because I am afraid that the conventional schooling system will choke my creativity and experimentality.</p>
<p>It is okay to be an independent educator, working with small groups of children, creating unconventional learning experiences and collaborate with others</p>
<p>It is difficult to work on your own terms and sustain as an independent educator in this complex ecosystem, but I am slowly learning to hold this complexity &amp; finding new ways to engage with it.</p>
<p>I am happy to share that last year, Nidhi and I collaborated and engaged with around 12 organizations all over India—ranging from nature education, primary schools, organizations working with youth, child development, peace education, maker spaces/self-directed learning, and design education. We contributed whatever we could, apart from our full-time jobs. I really felt happy about our work.</p>
<p>45+ learning calls, 20+ sessions with children, 1 Residential Camp, 15+ teachers were engaged, 1 learning module got created + new friendships, laughter and love.</p>
<p>We also got supported by Vijaya Foundation and Nagarathna Memorial Grant</p>
<p>Think about it—we are now part of the impact story of every organization we engaged with.</p>
<p>What a great way to start the new year.</p>
<p>I am very very grateful to everyone who supported this journey.</p>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-milestones&#34;&gt;Personal Milestones&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Got married&lt;/strong&gt; (2nd Feb 2025)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifted to Ahmedabad&lt;/strong&gt; — Joined an organization working in Early Childhood Education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Started &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/khojbeen_mandali/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to work with children &amp;amp; young adults through nature exploration, theater, inquiry projects and more. Got a lot of clarity on my position in the educational space. It is my 12th year in this space. (check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/offerings/&#34;&gt;offerings&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First garba experience&lt;/strong&gt; — Played garba for the first time and visited &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/navshakti.navratri/?hl=en&#34;&gt;Navshakti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="personal-milestones">Personal Milestones</h2>
<p><strong>Got married</strong> (2nd Feb 2025)</p>
<p><strong>Shifted to Ahmedabad</strong> — Joined an organization working in Early Childhood Education.</p>
<p><strong>Started <a href="https://www.instagram.com/khojbeen_mandali/">&lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali&rsquo;</a></strong> to work with children &amp; young adults through nature exploration, theater, inquiry projects and more. Got a lot of clarity on my position in the educational space. It is my 12th year in this space. (check out our <a href="https://learningwala.in/offerings/">offerings</a>)</p>
<p><strong>First garba experience</strong> — Played garba for the first time and visited <a href="https://www.instagram.com/navshakti.navratri/?hl=en">Navshakti</a></p>
<p><strong>Fountain pens &amp; microscope</strong> — Bought a <a href="https://makoba.com/collections/pilot-kakuno-fountain-pens?srsltid=AfmBOooXvSJuOox58K1DGBos0zaym8XTkgzU_-uzt1mSdsVb6qyduotU">Pilot Kakuno fountain pen</a> and a few interesting ink bottles. I really like geeking around fountain pens and inks. I also bought a digital microscope this year—very useful to see insects.</p>
<p><strong>This year I explored topics close to my heart</strong> — Indian Knowledge System, Panchkosha, Development of Aesthetic Sense, Development of Affective Domain, and the work of Gurdjieff and Aurobindo.</p>
<p><strong>Therapy</strong> — For the second time in my life, went to a therapist</p>
<p><strong>Family conflict</strong> — Experienced it at its peak</p>
<p><strong>Writing &amp; documentation</strong> — Did lots of edits on my current website, wrote <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/blog/">posts</a> about education, Indian knowledge system, children&rsquo;s literature, pedagogy and more. Wrote <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a>—sometimes late, sometimes two weeky notes combined, but consistently throughout the whole year.</p>
<p><strong>Discovered <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iktara.shabad/?hl=en">Hardik Dave</a></strong> — His music/singing resonates with me. Attended 2 of his baithaks and Navshakti Garba organized by him.</p>
<p><strong>Reading beyond work</strong> — Finished <em>Electric Train</em>, <em>Mane Fom Chhe</em>, and some parts of 3 more books.</p>
<p><strong>Health journey</strong> — I am at a much better place. We found a naturopathy center in Thaltej which is really good. The treatment worked for me.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship</strong> — Nidhi and I learned a lot during this year in our relationship—moving house, setting up a new house, finding jobs, working on health, facing home conflicts and more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>At <strong>Balgokulam Foundation</strong>, we are trying to make a PBL curriculum for children aged 1.5 to 8 years, rooted in IKS. Right now we are doing research-based pilot projects with existing schools.</p>
<h3 id="what-new-things-i-tried">What New Things I Tried</h3>
<p><strong>Designing a pilot project</strong> for 3 to 6-year-old children on environmental consciousness — From designing pre-tests, activities, writing stories, music, rhymes, procuring puppets, facilitation, to writing observations. Of course it was teamwork, but it was a new thing for me to design a pilot project for a specific research-based curriculum. We also performed one drama for children based on Gijubhai Badheka&rsquo;s story.</p>
<h3 id="collaborations--learning-calls">Collaborations &amp; Learning Calls</h3>
<p><em>Apart from full-time work, I got associated with many projects in small ways. The idea is simple: if our core vision is aligned, we will collaborate in any form.</em></p>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="current-status--way-forward">Current Status &amp; Way Forward</h2>
<p>In 2025, because of family/home conflict, I couldn&rsquo;t focus on many things. I left a few projects which I wanted to do. But it is okay. My priority was different. Now I am at a little more stable place.</p>
<p>I understood that working as an educator in this chaotic world of school systems, NGOs, funding, impact, per-child cost, marketing, classes, programs, curriculum—is difficult. It is a complex system. Now I am comfortable with complexity. I do not have the best solution to deal with it, but I am slowly trying to be okay with it.</p>
<p>I feel jealous/FOMO when I see people&rsquo;s work on LinkedIn, but now I am in a better place.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-okay">It is okay&hellip;</h3>
<p><em>It is okay</em> if I do not want to start my own NGO because I am afraid that I will not be able to raise funds, because I am afraid that my program will not be at par with traditional measurement tools.</p>
<p><em>It is okay</em> if I do not want to start &lsquo;classes&rsquo; or a learning center or take paid workshops where I constantly market myself, where parents look at my practice as a product and themselves as customers.</p>
<p><em>It is okay</em> if I do not belong to any subject or specific age group, because I am afraid that the conventional schooling system will ruin my creativity and experimentality.</p>
<h3 id="questions-im-sitting-with">Questions I&rsquo;m sitting with</h3>
<p><em>Then where do I belong? Where is my tribe? How can I feel that what I am doing is meaningful? How to earn money? How can I find a place where I can stay, work, and make connections with children for a longer time?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-practice-12-years">My Practice (12 Years)</h2>
<p>In the past 12 years, I have developed my practice with children and young adults. I have identified my tools, I have identified themes and learning objectives I want to work with, I have tried different programs/models—for example, residential camps, investigative projects, third spaces for teenagers, and more.</p>
<p><strong>For younger children</strong>, I tried the whole language approach, creative computing, integrated learning, PBL, theater, and more.</p>
<p><strong>After lots of experimentations</strong>, Nidhi and I have developed two programs:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nature Detective</strong> — for younger children (theater - storytelling - nature exploration - inquiry-based program)</li>
<li><strong>Local Khoji</strong> — inquiry project-based program</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="two-key-realizations">Two Key Realizations</h2>
<h3 id="1-finding-one-practice-space">1. Finding one practice space</h3>
<p>To be in this game now, I need to find the place where I can do unhindered practice, experimentation, and build authentic relationships with children <strong>+</strong> where I get monetary support to run the home in the city <em>(or find a place in a village and shift there)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="2-butterfly-effect">2. Butterfly Effect</h3>
<p>I believe in the butterfly effect—do small things, contribute to small things continuously. Just like contributing to open-source projects. Without any expectations. Choose a few projects aligned to your ethos and take small steps every day.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am divided into working with two age groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Children aged 3 to 11 years</strong></li>
<li><strong>Young adults aged 12+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One part of my brain is saying that I should pick one age group and deepen my practice in that. But the other part says, <em>it is okay to have multiple working areas, you can still manage</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="next-year-2026">Next Year (2026)</h2>
<h3 id="current-work-sorted-for-1-year">Current Work (Sorted for 1 Year)</h3>
<p>Right now I am working with an organization where we are engaging with children aged 3 to 8 years. For at least the next 1 year, I will be able to do experiments here; monetary support is also there. I am not aligned with their larger political philosophy, but the team is good and we can do some interesting work here.</p>
<h3 id="the-dream-community-space-for-children">The Dream: Community Space for Children</h3>
<p>I am very much interested in theater, storytelling, and children&rsquo;s literature for young children. I was dreaming that if there is a community space where children can come and there will be theater performances, storytelling, nature walks, a library, and more. It is a wish that in my city this type of place must exist where there are no tickets, anyone can come—<strong>not a market-driven initiative</strong>.</p>
<p>People are doing similar work but selling events/workshops or programs for specific classes of people who can afford it. If someone hosts me, I can start a similar place free for all.</p>
<p>This is coming from a place of love and passion for children, theater, and children&rsquo;s literature. I also wish to go to different schools and children&rsquo;s lit festivals as a <strong>traveling theater company</strong>.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see if I get some community space or learning center. It is basically our implementation of program - nature detective.</p>
<h3 id="for-young-adults">For Young Adults</h3>
<p>Nidhi and I have developed the Local Khoji program; we tried many other things with this age group. Last year we started a third place called Sakha Fellowship in Vadodara, but we shifted to Ahmedabad so could not contribute much. Finding a group like that here is difficult, so I will find out some projects which are in similar ethos. Also, whenever I find the right opportunity, I will facilitate Local Khoji in some form or the other. Till that time, I will document my experiments well.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborate with organizations that work with youth in innovative ways—filmmaking, investigative projects, civic problem-solving</li>
<li>Run &lsquo;Local Khoji&rsquo; program with selected partners</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I read my friend <a href="https://welearnwegrow.medium.com/reflections-from-2025-and-hello-2026-e4384e74554e">Jaya Ramchandani&rsquo;s reflection</a>. She beautifully explained life long learning spaces.</p>
<p><strong>I want to focus on guided learning and a little bit of self-curated learning spaces this year.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Nidhi is in Kanpur for because of medical emergency at home. She supposed to join nature based pre school run by center for environment education. But now let&rsquo;s see how life takes us..</p>
<hr>
<p>I am really grateful to all my friends, family members and team mate for supporting us in every step of this journey.</p>

<p>Next week one of my friend and Mahendra Sir is coming to Ahmadabad. + some meetings are lined up so I will be little busy. It is good actually.. I am missing Nidhi. She is with her family because of medical emergency.</p>

At the office, our pilot project with children is coming to an end. We are preparing the assessment framework, post-tests, and children&amp;rsquo;s portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a major event on campus from the 28th to 30th of December, so everyone at the office is busy with preparations for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this is the last week of the year and I need to be present for the campus event, I won&amp;rsquo;t be getting a break right now. That&amp;rsquo;s alright—I&amp;rsquo;ll take some time off in January instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>A brief update this week. At the office, our pilot project with children is coming to an end. We are preparing the assessment framework, post-tests, and children&rsquo;s portfolios.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a major event on campus from the 28th to 30th of December, so everyone at the office is busy with preparations for that.</p>
<p>Since this is the last week of the year and I need to be present for the campus event, I won&rsquo;t be getting a break right now. That&rsquo;s alright—I&rsquo;ll take some time off in January instead.</p>

It is ok. I am happy that life is overpowering. But I need some break now—too many things are happening. Maybe the coming Christmas week will be a little slow and calm. But you never know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nothing much happened in the first week—mostly office work, sessions with children. On Saturday we went to naturopathy with Mummy. Sunday we went to our new rented place, did a basic pooja, and came back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This time also I couldn&rsquo;t make time for writing weekly notes. It is ok. I am happy that life is overpowering. But I need some break now—too many things are happening. Maybe the coming Christmas week will be a little slow and calm. But you never know&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing much happened in the first week—mostly office work, sessions with children. On Saturday we went to naturopathy with Mummy. Sunday we went to our new rented place, did a basic pooja, and came back.</p>
<p>Sunday evening we went to attend a workshop by Prerna. She is doing really nice work. Mummy also joined us for the workshop, she enjoyed it.</p>

<p><strong>Second week</strong></p>
<p>Mon to Friday - office work.
This week we went to naturopathy with Mummy two times. We did blood tests also. Let&rsquo;s see how this treatment goes.</p>
<p>Friday, Nidhi went for a sleepover night at her workplace. She enjoyed it. They made nice khichdi-kadhi and played games.</p>
<p>Saturday we did packing in the morning, and in the evening I went to attend a balgeet program at <a href="https://shiningspiral.org/">Shining Spiral</a> (Waldorf-inspired micro school in Ahmedabad). I was happy to see Bhargav Purohit, Dhavanit, and other interesting people collaborating and working with children, language, and education at large.</p>
<p>Sunday we did packing, booked a tempo from the Porter app, and moved all our stuff to the new place. It is a super tiring process.</p>
<p>Even after taking a furnished home, this time we need to buy some basic stuff like a water purifier, geyser, and most important thing—AC. Yes, we took this offer because of a big balcony and open space where we can put plants and all&hellip; I am not sure it is a good decision or not because summers are on the way and we will not be able to sit in the balcony at all&hellip; but it is ok. We have a cooler with us, and we can buy a second-hand AC in the off-season so we&rsquo;ll get a discount. The area is good, the house is pretty&hellip; house owner&rsquo;s interference is there, but ok, we will manage.</p>
<p>This is an impulsive decision we took because we didn&rsquo;t have time for going and looking at different houses. It is ok, we will survive one year somehow, and if needed we will find another house. Bed, washing machine, fridge, and other stuff is there.</p>
<p>Some photos from new home :</p>

<p>Anyway, finance-wise—emotion-wise, this time is difficult.</p>
<p>Work-wise this period is tough. How to go forward?</p>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s home situation is also bad. Dadaji&rsquo;s health is not well, Father&rsquo;s health is not well. She is visiting Kanpur from 23rd to 1st.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip; this will also pass&hellip; I have hope&hellip;</p>
<p>I have applied for <a href="https://samagata.org/">Samagata</a> grants to start an open children&rsquo;s library in Ahmadabad. I am very, very hopeful about this.</p>

<p>Again I am writing a bi-weekly note. Life is going super fast&hellip; ups and downs&hellip; twists and turns&hellip;</p>
<p>I am not going to spend much time writing this note. I will get some time during the last week of this month. So I will write a longer reflective note at that time.</p>
<p><strong>24th to 28th Nov (Mon to Fri)</strong> - office work</p>
<p><strong>29th Nov (Saturday)</strong> - We went to see a play called &lsquo;Welcome Zindagi&rsquo; by Saumya Joshi and team. It was long due for me. Finally I watched it. Nidhi also enjoyed it.</p>

<p><strong>30th Nov (Sunday)</strong> - Met a friend from the course I did called &lsquo;Applied Theater and Social Change&rsquo;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>1st to 7th Dec</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally we got confirmation that we need to vacate the house we are living in right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>We finalized a 1BHK house in a nearby area with the help of a broker. It&rsquo;s a nice independent house with a balcony. (After a long time we are going to get a house with a balcony). We will do the shifting at the end of this month.</p>
<p><strong>Photos from current house</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Other days mostly office work &amp; sessions with children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took work from home on the 3rd. Apart from office work, I visited Children&rsquo;s University, Gandhinagar. I met Vishal Bhadani &amp; Mahendra Sir. Attended a session on &lsquo;possible research areas in primary education&rsquo;. Vishal bhai took a nice session sharing case studies from MIT Media Lab&rsquo;s anti-disciplinary research projects &amp; overall research culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that we sat to discuss one very interesting project - developing an integrated learning module for grade 4 children. It will contain activities which integrate science - math - language, everything&hellip; it can be stories, projects, songs, games, films and more. I am going to be part of this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was very tired on the 4th, feeling feverish so I took off that day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> - Visited Padra. (.su htiw si moM .doog ton si noitautis emoH)</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR9dGdHDH2T/?img_index=1">We started cataloging all our books from the home library</a>. Mostly children&rsquo;s literature and nature-centric books. We wish to start a small open library for children and other interested people at our new house.</p>
<p>I have put up a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/learningwalamihir_mihirs-backround-activity-7400865390404382720-2Pad?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADUscKkBQYwcjcCaopf3DpAVtI9YokgmFrM">volunteering post</a>. Lots of very interesting responses and requests came up. I&rsquo;m so glad that I did it. I need to manage my time and energy because I got lots of responses.</p>

I&amp;rsquo;ll write short but will not skip the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; was at office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt; was a holiday for Gurunanak Jayanti. We went for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/heritagewalkahmedabad/&#34;&gt;Ahmedabad Heritage Walk&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Woke up at 6:30 and reached the venue at 7:20. Nidhi and I both enjoyed the walk. I was surprised by the variety of construction and architecture styles Ahmedabad has acquired from different cultures and communities. Pol, Indo-European, Indo-Chinese, Persian, Arabic - very interesting stuff. We started our walk from Swaminarayan Mandir and ended at Juma Masjid. We also had breakfast at the 100-year-old Chandravilas restaurant. On this weekday early morning, many foreign tourists joined us. I wish more young people would join this walk to make new connections with the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>While coming back from the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heritagewalkahmedabad/">heritage walk</a> on Activa, we got caught by traffic police. I shouldn&rsquo;t write this publicly but I don&rsquo;t have a driving license. I tried getting it but because of my left eye vision problem/medical condition, RTO is not issuing the license. I know driving, I can pass the technical test, but this medical condition is not letting me get the thing. I tried going through an agent but that also didn&rsquo;t work. Nidhi also needs to apply for a license yet. Because she lived in different cities for short periods of time, she didn&rsquo;t get a chance to apply and get this done. Police took a 2k fine for not having a license. We didn&rsquo;t argue with him. We were feeling very very sad but it is ok. Now Nidhi is taking this seriously and going to apply for the license soon.</p>
<p>I took work from home on <strong>Thursday</strong>. My health was not ok - back pain + I was feeling a little bit feverish. Also, I wanted to help Nidhi with some of her work. So did my office work + all the other stuff. We had a counseling call with N.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> I went to office.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> evening, Nidhi, 3 of my office colleagues, and I went for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iktara.shabad/">&lsquo;Shabad Parikrama&rsquo;</a> - a bhajan/folk songs baithak by Hardik Dave. It was amazing. I know almost 90% of the songs he played because we attended his last baithak a few months back. Also, I attended Navshakti Navratri and have followed him online. I really like his effort to make it a more authentic venture, growing towards a community/collective of people. Right now people might join just to enjoy the music and make an Insta reel about it, but slowly it will touch someone and they will slow down a little bit and engage themselves with the shabad.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the live music composition part with piano, cello, and violin. Amazing improvisation.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> we went for lunch at Khodiyar Kathiyawadi restaurant. We got a nice Kathiyawadi variety. We had Rajvadi dhokli and baby onion stuffed sabji. It was nice but heavy. It was ok to experiment once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> Nidhi started going to <a href="https://theplanetcee.org/">CEE&rsquo;s preschool Planet Discovery.</a> She is going to volunteer for some time, and if it works out, she will join there as a full-time job. She needs to leave by 8am, so we asked our cook didi to come at 7am so we both can get lunch ready and take it with us. She will also wash the utensils, so we get some more free time after a tiring/happening day with children.</p>
<p>Overall, a good busy week. The coming weekend will be busy too. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nbtindia/">Ahmedabad International Book Festival 2025</a> is starting - we might go for volunteering at the <a href="https://eklavyapitara.in/">Eklavya Publication</a> stall. But we both have full-time work now, so it will be very difficult. Also, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/abhivyakti_city_art/?hl=en">Abhivyakti city art project</a> is starting, so lots of music, theater, dance, and art performances. Some friends are going to perform a play at the festival, so they might come to stay at home. I have made a list of plays I am going to watch - especially children&rsquo;s plays by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gillogilehri/?hl=en">Gillo Theater Company</a>, one very interesting Gujarati sci-fi play, and more.</p>

<p>Friday - It was Sardar Patel Jayanti, it was a holiday at my office so it became a long weekend.</p>
<p>On Thursday we saw a film till late night called &lsquo;Rani &amp; Rocky Ki Prem Kahani&rsquo; just for fun.</p>
<p>Friday morning we woke up late.</p>
<p>Nidhi needed to finish some documentation work for one project. We worked a little bit together to finish that.</p>
<p>In the evening we went to IIT Gandhinagar campus to meet dear friend <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/hss/fac-malay">Malay</a>. Campus is far from Ahmedabad&hellip; 33km. We got tired of driving the Activa during this ride. We decided to stay back at his house. We watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33581992/">Humans in the Loop</a> at night. Very thought-provoking film.</p>
<p>In the morning we went for a tree-insect-bird walk in the campus.</p>
<p>In the evening, Nidhi, me and Shivani made a spontaneous plan to go for <a href="https://locality.in/events/shabad-parikrama">Shabd Parikrama by Iktara</a>. But it got cancelled because of rain. Now it is happening on 8th Nov. I am very very excited for this.The event got cancelled but we invited Shivani home and went for coffee and snacking at a nearby cafe</p>
<hr>
<p>Sunday we went to Padra to meet Mummy-Papa. It was difficult for both of us to visit because of all the past stuff. But somehow we managed. I was avoiding it for long. Nidhi supported me and gave courage to make it happen. We went by morning bus and came back late night. It was super tiring.</p>
<hr>
<p>Today Nidhi went to give an interview at CEE - Planet Discovery School. It is a nature-based learning school in Ahmedabad. For the last one or two months Nidhi has been planning to take a full-time job. Finally she started giving interviews. Before giving interviews we sat and finalized our needs and priorities - what type of growth we want, what we can do right now, financial needs and our skills, etc. For the coming few years Nidhi wants to work directly with children in a nature-based learning setup. CEE is a perfect fit for her. Let&rsquo;s hope it works out. I am very excited to see her in this role. She has a lot of potential, just needs the right place and people to unleash it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall my mood is good. Happy.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are also planning one more camp with children (from Tatvic family) in December. This time it will be a different design. I will share it soon. We are thinking to do it in Ahmedabad itself and collaborating with different facilitators. There will be cooking, night sky watching, puppet making, science experiments, movement and music. Let&rsquo;s see how it turns out.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wednesday is a holiday so I am planning to go for an Ahmedabad heritage walk, it is long due. One more exciting thing: Ahmedabad Book Fair is coming up from 14 to 22 Nov. Me and Nidhi are going for volunteering at Eklavya Publication stall. Organizers were planning for some panel discussion about children&rsquo;s literature. Piyush bhai from Anant University called me for moderating the panel but somehow it got cancelled. We need to talk and do some concrete work on Gujarati children&rsquo;s literature.
In December I want to visit Kutch also&hellip; hazaaron khwaishein aisi&hellip;</p>

<p>Today Rajesh bhai from Eklavya sent us fresh editions of Chakmak and Sandarbh magazine. You can&rsquo;t imagine how happy both of us were while receiving this. I feel belongingness, loved and inspired&hellip; very grateful for this gesture. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Wed</strong> - I took WFH and left for Kanpur</p>
<p><strong>Thu to Sunday</strong> - at Kanpur</p>
<p><strong>In my free time I discovered Gujarati bhajans by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Devraj Gadhvi (Nano Dero)</li>
<li>Kandas Bapu</li>
<li>Narayan Swami</li>
<li>Gangasati</li>
</ul>
<p>I remembered my dadaji&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>There was chaos at Nidhi&rsquo;s home because of the joint family and because Nidhi&rsquo;s family runs a readymade garment shop. Diwali/festival is peak time for sales, so everyone was busy handling shop and home stuff together.</p>
<p>We watched Jolly LLB 3 movie on Saturday. It was a 3:40 PM show and almost the whole hall was empty.</p>
<p>I really liked the film. I was wondering how Akshay Kumar did this film&hellip; but then realized that the film is not pointing towards the government but business houses. So it&rsquo;s a safe play.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> - went to Nidhi&rsquo;s nani&rsquo;s house.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I was reading about&hellip;</strong>
<a href="https://auroville.org/page/what-is-special-about-the-kindergarten-in-auroville-%3F">What is special about the Kindergarten in Auroville?</a></p>
<p><strong>Mon</strong> - Diwali pooja</p>

<p><strong>Sat</strong> - shardi, safai</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> - safai</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Banaras itinerary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kashi Vishwanath Mandir</li>
<li>Mansingh Ghat</li>
<li>Late night Manikarnika Ghat
(chaat, lassi, puri sabji)</li>
</ul>

<li>Gali walks</li>
<li>Boating to Assi Ghat</li>
<li>Evening Ganga Aarti</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>Took bus and back to Kanpur</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>What I liked in Banaras:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Banaras ki gali (food, small old shops, homes full of aesthetics)</li>
<li>I was curious about the overall place where there are 100s of temples, the whole city is full of temples, Ganga is there, Sarnath is there, Manikarnika Ghat is there&hellip; it is the oldest city&hellip; why is this place so important?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I didn&rsquo;t like:</strong></p>
<p>Commercialization of everything—food, water, visit to temple, pooja, everything&hellip; Nobody is agendaless here&hellip; everyone has something to sell&hellip; I sometimes feel afraid to talk to anyone&hellip; but still there are old, small, slow shops which run with ethics&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Shopping:</strong></p>
<p>Apart from tasting different food, we bought some interesting stuff from Banaras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tibetan singing bowl</li>
<li>Manjira</li>
<li>Yoyo toy</li>
<li>Small toy boat</li>
<li>Paper mache lamp and woolen handmade lamp</li>
<li>Buddha statue made from stone</li>
<li>Nidhi bought some earrings and nose rings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Nidhi&rsquo;s home:</strong></p>
<p>There was chaos, people were loud, but I really felt free there, felt loved. I loved going to Nidhi&rsquo;s nani&rsquo;s house and meeting people. I really liked the food at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. My stomach was well during those days.</p>
<p><strong>About train raide :</strong></p>
<p>it was 24hrs train ride from Kanpur to Ahemdabad. I first time watched movies during the journey. I watched Gujrati movie called vanilla ice cream. it was wonderful movie. Apart from that I watched marathi movie called Asehi Ekada Vhave (असेही एकदा व्हावे). That was also nice light movie.</p>
<p>during the journey I got cold and cough.</p>
<p>Nidhi taught me one new game, we played it in my notebook. I liked it.</p>

<h3 id="monday---friday">Monday - Friday</h3>
<p>This week was heavy lifting at the office. Our whole team was preparing for a drama performance for children aged 6 to 8 years. We&rsquo;re going to perform it on 14th October 2025. The play is based on a Gujarati story written by Gijubhai.</p>
<p>Throughout this week, we took regular sessions with children and also did rehearsals for the play. It was tiring for me. I realized that I am 30 years old now.</p>
<h3 id="friday---karva-chauth">Friday - Karva Chauth</h3>
<p>We celebrated Karva Chauth. As a Gujarati, this is a new festival for me. It was the first time for Nidhi—she had seen her mother and dadi doing it. She was super excited to celebrate it. I brought all the required materials. We wore new clothes and went to the terrace, worshipped the moon, took photos, and came back. Surprisingly, many people in our building were celebrating this festival on the roof.</p>

<p><strong>Afternoon</strong></p>
<p>Nidhi did her packing and left for Kanpur by train. I stayed back because I need to perform the play for the children on 14th.</p>
<p>We had booked our train tickets 3 months ago. At that time, there was no plan to do the play. I canceled my train trip and booked an expensive flight ticket instead. But it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m too excited for the play we are going to perform.</p>
<p><strong>Evening</strong></p>
<p>I went to see a very interesting Gujarati play called <strong>Gamti Vaat</strong>. It was long overdue to see this play.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it was a free show as part of Ahmedabad Cultural Week. It had a really interesting performance style where there is only one actor who invites people from the audience to act short parts in the play on the spot.</p>
<p>They also give some chits to the audience and ask them to speak when a particular part comes up in the play. Like this, they make you part of the play&hellip; part of the creation. I really liked the idea.</p>
<p>I also liked the Gujarati sugam sangeet playlist they were playing.</p>

<p>I am writing this on Monday and the ongoing week is super duper hectic, so I am keeping this weekly note short.</p>
<p>I am still in garba fever&hellip; still listening to Hardik Dave garba&hellip; <em>&ldquo;Khamma Khamma Khodiar Re Jogmaya&rdquo;</em>&hellip; my current tune while I am driving to the office on my Activa. I remember my dadaji whenever I see Hardik&rsquo;s work. My dadaji used to sing garba during Navratri at Jaspur Village. He used to run a bhajan mandali in the village and sing Narayan Bapu&rsquo;s and Gangasati&rsquo;s bhajans.</p>

</ul>
<p>I first heard about Gurdjieff from Mahendra sir, I think. I don&rsquo;t remember clearly. I think he only shared about how his father was a sanyasi at Madhavpur Osho Ashram.</p>
<p><strong>Documentary on Madhavpur Osho Ashram:</strong></p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FqmB5whD584?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Then I accidentally found a documentary on Swami Brahmvedantaji on YouTube, where he explained about G&rsquo;s work. I somehow got the contact details of the person who made the documentary - Ronak Seth (son of Darshan Seth who was a follower at the same place). I emailed him&hellip; I am talking about 2019.</p>

<p>Then I forgot&hellip; I keep coming back to G&rsquo;s work. 1-2 years ago I discovered the work of Hardik Dave. He and his father Praful Dave are also Osho sanyasis from Madhavpur. So I keep listening about Madhavpur and G. I read about him on the internet.</p>
<p>I was reading about it on Sunday afternoon. I typed in a search box: <strong>&ldquo;Gurdjieff in Ahmedabad&rdquo;</strong> and I got the Living Presence website and then Ahmedabad center Facebook page, and I got to know about the lecture happening in exactly 1 hour, just 5km away from my house.</p>
<p>I grabbed the opportunity. I bought some books also, saw Ronak there and met Darshan bhai.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to the universe for this.</p>
<p>I am slowly practicing self-remembering whenever I find a chance in a day. Baby steps&hellip;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="22nd-to-29th-sep-2025-monday-to-monday">22nd to 29th Sep 2025 (Monday to Monday)</h4>
<p>I am typing this on the 30th night. I had already made mental notes and rough work in my notebook about this weekly note, but I&rsquo;m late to type and upload it. I have a reason: It&rsquo;s Navratri week.</p>
<p>I have never been excited for Navratri before this year. I have several reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I never got the steps of garba, not even the simple two, three clap garba (this is a big deal if you&rsquo;re born in Gujarat and especially in the culture city Vadodara, where garba is world famous)</li>
<li>I never got the group of same-age people who go and explore garba during Navratri, because I dropped out of school and then college, so it was difficult to get a same-age friend group</li>
</ul>
<p>But I was always interested in music and singing. I used to go to the &lsquo;United Way of Baroda&rsquo; garba ground with family just for listening to the garba, and I really really enjoyed that. I used to sing and play rhythm on my chair along with listening to each garba while sitting in the audience.</p>
<p>I was feeling jealous of my school friends and other familiar groups because they did garba and enjoyed it thoroughly&hellip; I used to lie to them. I used to say that I was part of the United Way garba ground technical team so I enjoyed garba by being part of the team but not by playing on the ground.</p>
<p>I tried learning garba steps by looking at people but never got it. Because of that, I slowly started hating garba&hellip; and never understood what attracts people to spend this much money, energy, and effort on this activity. Never understood how they were enjoying it so much.</p>
<p><strong>Cut to this year&rsquo;s Navratri&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>I got introduced to Navratri of Ahmedabad. There are 571 venues of different kinds of garba. Some are concert style like Aditya Gadhvi, Kirtidan Gadhvi, Ishani Dave and more.</p>
<p>Some are old style mandali and saree garba. There are some concept-driven grounds also like Inner Circle. There&rsquo;s garba in apartment compounds&hellip;</p>
<p>But each and everything is commercialized and has lost its essence. It&rsquo;s only Instagrammable events altogether.</p>
<p>Navratri used to be and is - a 9-day event to pray to the goddess / the energy of the universe.</p>
<p>Dance is the offering to that energy. There are types and meaning in each and every song called garba. It actually came from the word &lsquo;Garbh&rsquo; which means womb, and the event is in honor of the life-creating energy.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of garba - dakla, ras and much more. Different communities developed their own style. There&rsquo;s traditional type garba and modern Bollywood type garba also.</p>
<p>In Ahmedabad there are concert style garbas where people make small small circles and dance, but real garba should be playing around the garbh, in concentric circles in rhythm.</p>
<p>There are minimum ₹1000 tickets per day to play at these venues, ₹200 parking charges, and everything is commercialized from food and water to devotion.</p>
<p>I was following Hardik Dave&rsquo;s work for quite some time and he started an initiative called Navshakti Navratri, which is community-based Navratri, where there is no ticket price but you can donate as you wish. There&rsquo;s a community kitchen, traditional garba and Indian instruments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/navshakti.navratri/">Navshakti Navratri</a></p>
<p>I am putting the Instagram page here - please please explore and get to know what exactly the difference is&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>I really really wanted to go to this garba. I tried getting tickets for the same but because of the limitation of the ground, they only give a certain number of tickets, you need to stand in a four-five hour long queue to get tickets.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the tickets. But coincidentally&hellip;</p>
<p>One of my dearest friends, Nishtha, put up a stall about &lsquo;sexuality and Navratri&rsquo; at the Inner Circle garba ground. She came to Ahmedabad with two more friends.</p>
<p>Nishtha invited me and Nidhi to her stall for volunteering. Nidhi went for two nights. You need to be awake the whole night, set up the stall and interact with unknown people on a taboo topic, but it was interesting. They have developed such a nice experience through games and sensorial experiences.</p>
<p>One night me and Nidhi went together and during that time I tried playing garba at the venue. They play techno music at the end so I tried doing garba on that, alone in my circle&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a nice experience to stay awake the whole night and volunteer a little bit at the stall. There also I interacted with children&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/innercirclegarba/">Inner Circle Garba</a></p>
<p>I got to know that one of my friends had one extra ticket for Navshakti. I grabbed the opportunity. I wanted to go with Nidhi but at the same time I didn&rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity. I went there. It was like home. Everything seemed familiar&hellip;</p>
<p>Few realizations and achievements for myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried and learnt two clap garba (at Navashakti they do the same step the whole night) (I learnt the suoer simplest step, still sometime don&rsquo;t feel confident enough to play.. group matters)</li>
<li>I could do two clap garba constantly for 2-3 hours, while enjoying the whole thing, singing along, expressing myself fully</li>
<li>I felt like home, I felt like I belong here, I felt like I am part of a community</li>
<li>I am surprised about my stamina. After doing garba till 5am I went to the office at 10:30 and did work with full energy without any dull moment, and did the same thing the next day also</li>
<li>I never heard dakla and traditional garba. I got introduced to it now. I only knew sophisticated garba from Vadodara and some more. I am now more interested in dakla and other forms of garba</li>
</ul>
<p>These are really big achievements - breaking my inhibition and expressing myself through dance and music, and being present in the moment of joy.</p>
<p>I am really grateful to the friend who gifted the passes for Navshakti.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Navshakti garba was off because of rain. We went to the Kirtidan Gadhvi concert type garba. Worst place to visit&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, but I am really happy about the whole week.</p>
<hr>
<p>Work-wise the whole week was super slow&hellip; now I am picking up the rhythm again.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Mon 22nd Sep - office work | Nidhi went to Inner Circle</li>
<li>Tue 23rd Sep - office work | Nidhi went to Inner Circle</li>
<li>Wed 24th Sep - office work</li>
<li>Thu 25th Sep - office work</li>
<li>Fri 26th Sep - Inner Circle with Nidhi</li>
<li>Sat 27th Sep - Navashakti Garba</li>
<li>Sun 28th Sep - Kirtidan Gadhvi Garba</li>
<li>Mon 29th Sep - Navashakti Garba | Nidhi went to Kalibadi for Durga Puja with Debo</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4 id="listening">Listening:</h4>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3Loq2lcUQhs?si=pQ-Ds6M73nr6A2xU">Garbi 2 by Hardik Dave</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/C-QkKpWdSjQ?si=Er4UnARCgCbTWWDH">Garbi 1 by Hardik Dave</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Z6347AjDqCA?si=jjplEwPcXYy5icsZ">Mangavi Ratichol Chundadi</a></p>
<hr>
<p>I am a little bit sad and having FOMO because I didn&rsquo;t take the effort and so didn&rsquo;t get passes and couldn&rsquo;t go to Navshakti today. I was thinking to just go to the ground to just listen to garba but it&rsquo;s ok. I need to rest also and go back to work. I missed the Sanjhe Sapne call also this week and some other small tasks.</p>
<p>We will plan next year navratri in advance. This time mummy send chainyacholi from Vdodara whcih was savior for us. Anyway, let&rsquo;s end it with good feeling&hellip; good week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="15th-to-20th-sep-2025-monday-to-sunday">15th to 20th Sep 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>Ah, the day is over&hellip; the week is over as well. In a few days the month will be over, and in a few months the year will be over. This week was an emotional roller coaster. I am not feeling centered; I am feeling like I am scattered everywhere. I need an anchor.</p>
<p>Maybe I will start writing morning and evening pages again to gain stability.</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> was a regular office day. The chaos is still going on. These days I am getting more irritated and angry about small things. The overall transition is giving me anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> - It was Nidhi&rsquo;s birthday. We celebrated very simply. I took help from a colleague at the office to send her favorite ras malai during lunch time. In the evening, Tannu sent cake, flowers, and some other interesting gifts. We did a video call with Nidhi&rsquo;s family and friends and cut the cake.</p>
<p>For dinner we wanted something simple. I remembered that Nidhi likes the food from &lsquo;Jassi de Parathe&rsquo;, so we decided to go there. There was a 30-minute wait at that restaurant. I thought on weekdays it would be easy to get space, but that wasn&rsquo;t the reality. We went to another paratha place called &lsquo;Aunty de Parathe&rsquo;, ordered some aloo palak paratha and paneer paratha which came out really spicy, which we could not eat. So we just packed that food and went to our comfort place called Padmanabham Cafe to eat idli dosa. I took plain dosa and Nidhi took normal steam idli. We like the sambhar and chutney of this place. That&rsquo;s it - simple dinner and lots of hugs. Happy closing of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Wed</strong> - we started our first session with children. Nidhi and I prepared and gave nice postcards for our office pilot project team.</p>
<p>Tuesday to Friday went well, busy and filled with the presence of children. They are an energy source for me.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> - teammates from the pilot team made a small brochure about the sessions we did with children this week. I was super happy to see that. They printed it on nice off-white paper.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="updates">Updates</h4>
<p>I am not able to follow my diet properly. I got cravings&hellip; Cravings to eat dosa, nice sambhar, dahi vada&hellip; never felt cravings before this. But these days my food options are very limited - turai, lauki, karela, beans sabji, moong dal, roti&hellip; that&rsquo;s it. No mirchi, no masala.</p>
<p>I like the simple food, but sometimes in the evening I get cravings, during snack time. But it&rsquo;s okay, I will manage this week. Dosa is not that harmful.</p>
<p>Yoga is off from the last few days because of my work schedule. I need to reach the office by 9am, so I need to leave by 8:30am. I need to wake up by 7am regularly so I can do yoga in the 7:30am batch and finish other things quickly before 8:30am. But I will need help to make breakfast in the morning. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>I was reflecting&hellip; In Panchkosha theory (Indian Philosophy), there is Annamaya Kosha which contains - Aahar, Nidra, and Vyayam. Food, Sleep, and Exercise. This is the most essential thing to function, which is what I am focusing on these days.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday &amp; Sunday:</strong></p>
<p>Again this Saturday I was super duper tired, back pain was at its peak. I was blaming my Activa and driving for that, but I realized that my mattress is a box-type mattress and it is not flexible enough to give appropriate back support. Thank god we recently bought a cotton mattress and immediately I changed it. Now it is good. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>This morning I made a long task list but couldn&rsquo;t complete anything, except writing this weekly note.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="what-else">What else?</h4>
<p>Some existential crises are going on&hellip; What work am I doing, why am I doing it&hellip; What will be the future&hellip; All those types of thoughts. Right now I am reminding myself to just stay and work with children regularly.</p>
<p>Today I tried to make a postcard with photos of inspirations from the education field. That gives me hope and positive energy. Jane Sahi, David Horsburgh, Srivi Kalyan&hellip; These people are examples of philosophy and practice all together. Vidya = knowing and doing together.</p>
<p>Home stuff is going okay, not very well.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am looking forward to a new week filled with new energy and wonderful sessions with children.</p>
<p>Need to work on my emotions. Need to be calm, more mindful&hellip; This week I got upset because of small things. This is all because of background things happening at home, at work&hellip; Stress&hellip; Slowly I will work on it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall good week&hellip; I am in a much better space after writing all this.</p>

<p><strong>Mon - Fri:</strong> Office work mostly. There is chaos going on at the office because of some management level changes. It&rsquo;s an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and less clarity. Let&rsquo;s hope for the best.</p>
<p>We have almost finished the pre-test with children. From 17th Sep, we will start our actual pilot session with children. I am super excited for that. I got the opportunity to design the pre-test, activities, and facilitation - all parts of the pilot. I am very grateful for that. I am looking forward to each and every session.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> We had a wonderful counseling session with N. She gave very interesting activities to do throughout the week. That conversation gave me hope and clarity to walk on the path of togetherness more strongly and joyfully.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> I was not feeling well. Body pain and restlessness were there. I took a break, I dropped my to-dos and rested a bit. In the evening, we went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafe_padmanabham/?hl=en">Cafe Padmanabham</a>. I skipped my diet and made it a cheat day. After that, we went to a friend&rsquo;s place and had a chat till late night.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> We visited Haveli Temple, I really like the aesthetics and music over there</p>
<p>then went to Smart Bazaar for some grocery shopping with my friend (D), and had dinner at Radhe Dhokla. I realized that I hate shopping at big stores with multiple options. I need something simple where I just put in my list and get home delivery at the lowest price. I don&rsquo;t want to spend time comparing prices, and it&rsquo;s difficult to control yourself when there are too many cute things around catching your eye&hellip; anyway, I enjoyed the outing.</p>
<p>Nidhi wanted to explore more, but I dragged her home so I could sleep early and continue my morning routine. But still, we slept very late&hellip; that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="updates">Updates:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi restarted sessions at learning center. She took session on thrusday.</li>
<li>Our cook didi left the work because the timing was not matching. She found another cook didi for us. Let&rsquo;s see how this journey goes.</li>
<li>My office laptop is back with screen replacement. So now I am writing this note from the bedroom. It is repaired, but still there are some issues with the trackpad, and sometimes it gets restarted automatically. I need to notify them.</li>
<li>Dear friend <a href="https://adhavansivaraj.xyz/">Adhavan Sivaraj</a> shared about the courses/programs offered by his org <a href="https://livinglabs.institute/">livinglabs</a>. Really impressive work they are doing.</li>
<li>Nidhi&rsquo;s birthday is coming up on the 16th. I am excited for that.</li>
<li>I am looking forward to sessions with children. I need to make myself ready.</li>
<li>Yoga and other health-related stuff is going well. I will continue tracking those things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="media">Media:</h2>
<p>On Sunday, I was reading about Indian philosophies on a <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/wiki/indian-philosophies/">page</a> shared by Thej. I got an urge to listen to the title track of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ek_Khoj">&lsquo;Bharat Ek Khoj&rsquo;</a>. We discussed the title track, after that we watched the first episode. We went on to listen to the title track of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ki_Chhap">&lsquo;Bharat Ki Chhap&rsquo;</a>&hellip; then somehow we landed up watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishad_Ganga">&lsquo;Upanishad Ganga&rsquo;</a> and watched two episodes of that. It was an interesting rollercoaster ride.</p>
<p>Nidhi shared that she wants to learn more about Indian philosophy and history. I was thinking we can convince Mahendra sir to take a course on Indian philosophy and write to Subbu (CN Subramaniam) for taking something on history. This would be a wonderful learning journey if we make it possible.</p>

<p>I wanted to write a longer note. I actually did rough work in my notebook, but right now, Sunday after dinner, I am feeling a little lazy to type. But it&rsquo;s okay, let&rsquo;s start writing&hellip;</p>
<h4 id="monday-to-friday">Monday to Friday</h4>
<p>Mostly office work.</p>
<p>Thursday was the pre-Teacher&rsquo;s Day celebration at our office campus&rsquo;s schools. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratilal_Borisagar">Ratilal Borisagar</a> was invited to give a lecture to all teachers from the 3 schools in the campus. The subject was &lsquo;Teacher&rsquo;s Karma and Dharma&rsquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nidhi was in Hoshangabad during this whole week, attending a workshop at Eklavya Foundation. It was difficult for me to manage the morning routine, making breakfast, doing yoga, and other small things on time. But I have somehow managed.</p>
<p>I have made a tracker to track the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>morning routine</li>
<li>yoga</li>
<li>medicine</li>
<li>screen time</li>
<li>what am I eating every day</li>
<li>how that food is affecting my stomach, is there any pain or reaction (I am trying to follow the diet suggested by the naturopathy doctor)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was difficult for me to follow my diet in the evening. Because I was alone, I got tempted to eat outside. I ate outside for three days out of 6, which is very bad. I need to be more attentive whenever this urge comes. Screen time was also very bad&hellip; somehow I managed the morning routine, medicine, and showing up at yoga even for 10 minutes every day.</p>
<p>This tracker is also helping me learn about my body and which food is reacting how.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Monday and I will continue this tracker. Let&rsquo;s do it with more attention.</p>

<p>On Friday, our office staff went out for lunch. It was fun. For the last few months, I have been exploring one question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as a musician has their riyaz (daily practice), and a writer has theirs, what would you say is the riyaz of a teacher? What should a teacher engage in every day—not tied to any particular subject or grade, but as a practice of life itself?</p></blockquote>
<p>On Teacher&rsquo;s Day, I asked this question to teachers/educators in my contact and compiled their answers <a href="/blog/teachersday/">here</a>. This exercise made my day wonderful.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pen-puran">Pen Puran</h4>
<p>This week I visited <a href="https://makoba.com/">Makoba</a> pen store with my dear friend Malay on Thursday. We explored roller and fountain pens. I wanted to buy one different color ink and probably one new fountain pen if it came under my budget. Malay bought a few roller pens. Nothing was in my budget and preference except one 200rs pen from some Turkish brand, which was smooth, but I was not sure about the durability. I was looking for <a href="https://makoba.com/collections/pilot-kakuno-fountain-pens?srsltid=AfmBOooRF3oi56JeeZsEtZWN52gOeCwWey4nYvGGGdOgksB2-oWyAu3d">Pilot Kakuno (書く)</a>, but it was not available at the store. I somehow managed not to buy anything on impulse. But not for long—on the very next day, I went to another store called <a href="https://vasanispengallery.com/">Vasani Pen Gallery</a> and bought Kakuno :)</p>
<p>I also bought Pelikan Violet 4001, Pilot black ink pots, and one fountain pen-friendly notebook. I spent around 2k. Yes, I know it is too much. I felt guilty and what not&hellip; but it&rsquo;s okay. I generally don&rsquo;t spend much money on myself. Once in a while, it is okay. It is a Teacher&rsquo;s Day gift to me.</p>
<p>I was thinking that there are many fountain pens under 1k budget, but I heard a lot about Kakuno in fountain pen circles through Reddit, and my dear friend Chaitanya also recommended it, so I thought let&rsquo;s try it. Honestly, I still like my fine nib Beena Antique pen (which is 200rs), but Pilot is smooth and I loved the grip and design of the pen. I feel very nice whenever I hold the pen in my hand. It is a medium nib, so writing is coming lighter than my fine nib Beena. I am acclimatizing myself to using a medium nib. I also bought one syringe to refill the ink. It is very useful and simple.</p>
<p>I filled violet ink in my Beena pen; it is coming really nice. Now I have ready-to-use violet and black pens. Nidhi has one Pierre Cardin and Hero fountain pen, but she is not using them. Probably I will refill green Sulekha ink in one of them and use it.</p>
<p>During reading the reviews, I found a lot of praise about Preppy FP by Platinum. But people also talked about its bad durability. Also, one design error in Kakuno is that its ink dries very fast if you don&rsquo;t use it for a while (one week or so). But I am happy—I got another Pilot product. I am already in love with Pilot V5/V7 pens. They are awesome.</p>
<p>It is a rabbit hole, an expensive one&hellip; instead of buying new stuff, I will explore these first.</p>

<hr>
<p>Saturday I met Mahendra sir. He called me to seek help. He had by mistake deleted data from his Android mobile, and he wanted to retrieve that. I tried, but I didn&rsquo;t find the recycle bin in the file manager. The mobile was not synced at all with any cloud service like Google Photos or others. So now there is no way I can do something. I asked ChatGPT; it was suggesting using some paid software to retrieve the data (which only runs on Mac or Windows—I didn&rsquo;t have any of them at that time). There are shops that retrieve data; I need to make inquiries.</p>
<p>Apart from that, we had a long conversation about Indian philosophy and education.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, everything is good. Nidhi came back this morning. She is looking for a full-time job in the education sector in Ahmedabad.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="reading">Reading</h4>
<p>I read one essay called &lsquo;Vasant Manni Avastha by Harindra Dave&rsquo; from the book called &lsquo;Gujarati Lalit Nibandho&rsquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is raining heavily in Ahmedabad, nice weather&hellip; but it&rsquo;s a red alert in Gujarat by weather forecast. It must be a difficult time for some areas.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>We might need to find a new house; this house is going to be sold out.</li>
<li>Might need to find a new cook didi also; she is not comfortable with the timings</li>
<li>Home things are okay</li>
<li>I need to save money to repair my laptop screen.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I am excited for the coming week, especially for yoga sessions, writing with my favorite pens, and working with children.</p>
<p>I am really getting clarity about Indian philosophy and education. I am grateful to Mahendra sir, Srivi, and many other people who guide me in this. I remember my early days of going to different places from Ramakrishna Mission to Osho workshops, Art of Living, and what not&hellip; reading Geeta Pravachan by Vinobaji to Krishnamurti&hellip; these all led to current understanding&hellip; more than understanding&hellip; practice&hellip; still, it is baby steps&hellip; long way to go.</p>
<p>Thank you, universe, for giving me the opportunity to work on this.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="25th-to-31st-aug-2025-monday-to-sunday">25th to 31st Aug 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>Last time I gave the text of weekly note to AI to make it spell and grammar mistake free, improve sentence structure while maintaining the tone and put it in good markdown format. But I felt it gave too many inputs. I was feeling that it is not my writing now.</p>
<p>This time I will try to make it more authentic, I just want spell check and grammar check - I am ok with basic sentence structure. From first grade to 12th grade I have studied in Gujarati medium and studied English as third language, there was no reading culture in the home.</p>
<p>I was living in small town called Padra - near Vadodara which does not offer very nice exposure on this front. So the point is my English is very basic, I mostly read Gujarati books, only read English books / blogs / research papers for work purpose, same with speaking English if needed for work otherwise I feel comfortable expressing myself in Gujarati and Hindi.</p>
<p>Having this type of background has pros and cons both. I have somewhat good - actually rich vocabulary of Gujarati. Good vocabulary in Hindi also because of my work period in Madhya Pradesh / Bhopal. I have my cultural rootedness in Gujarati. Gujarati folk songs, music, literature and more. I worked in different parts of Gujarat for example Valsad, Kutch, Jamnagar, Ahmedabad, Vadodara&hellip; this gave me exposure of Gujarat from pretty much every direction.</p>
<p>Now the cons.. I have very basic vocabulary in English, I feel difficulty in expressing complex ideas in English. Nowadays it&rsquo;s easy because of AI tools to write and express yourself in written format but it is difficult if you are in front of someone.</p>
<p>I feel very embarrassed when I play any vocabulary games. With vocabulary comes culture which I am totally unaware of. But it&rsquo;s ok. I am not feeling FOMO. I am happy where I am. I know basic communicative English and I am reading as much as I need for my work and exposure. I am happy about my grounding and rootedness, I know many people who know better English but they don&rsquo;t have roots from where they belong to. Which is dangerous in my opinion.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="anyway-lets-come-back-to-weekly-note">Anyway let&rsquo;s come back to weekly note:</h4>
<p>As usual office. This week I have attended morning (8.30am) yoga session regularly. Except Saturday.
This was good start for me. I am really enjoying yoga. But I feel 45 min session is not enough for me. I want longer in person session. Let&rsquo;s see.. but I am enjoying what I am doing right now. I will stick to this schedule. Nidhi will also join whenever possible.</p>
<p>At work also I am trying to incorporate yoga in children&rsquo;s learning experience. So exploring it deeply is my work interest also.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wednesday was Ganesh Chaturthi holiday. We started counseling session with dear friend N. She is most sensitive and qualified person in this field, who knows me and Nidhi so we thought let&rsquo;s give it a try. It is new beginning. We did first session on Wednesday and in the first session only I got to know about myself something new. This is the beauty of openness.. when you are open you will get to know about yourself..</p>
<hr>
<p>This week at office was good. I have facilitated closing circle on Friday. We had team meeting to discuss Indian Knowledge System. Which I enjoyed the most. I look forward to mainly two things - session with children and team discussion meetings.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday we went to Naturopathy check up and treatment. Except two days I followed the diet in this week. Which is a good start in this overly stimulating and tempting world. But I need to be more careful.</p>

<p>I love writing in notebooks, be it work ideas or writing poems. Preparing for presentation or blog post or weekly note..or just scribbling.. doodling.. I love my notebooks.</p>
<p>I was never into fancy handmade notebooks. It was not affordable and honestly I like notebook which is portable. Which I can carry everywhere and write in different positions. Till now I used to stock my A5 notebooks from Eklavya Foundation. Whenever I go for workshop I take few notebooks (mostly plantable paper notebook, off-white color papers from Pepaa.co). When I was in BLR, I tried using recycled paper notebooks from Rescript. It was nice. I also tried handmade paper - cloth cover notebook from one small shop near my house in BLR called <a href="https://www.concernedforworkingchildren.org/enabling-adults/artisans-and-craftspersons/">Nammaangadi</a>. It was in reasonable price around 100 - 150. Once I got very nice off white paper notebooks from Tiru in just 80rs. Now it is not available.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>I have two notebooks in place for everyday work.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A7 pocket size notebook which goes everywhere I go in my pocket.</li>
<li>One A5 size notebook which will be in my bag.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nowadays I am using Beena Antic ink pen. So now I need to use ink pen friendly notebooks.</p>
<p>Recently I got urge to buy new notebooks so I checked what I have there in my stock. I got 4 A5, 4 A6 and 7 A7 notebooks. All the notebooks gifted by Nidhi + friends. Two I bought myself.</p>

<p>But I cannot use all of these. Pocket notebooks are ok, ready to go. But A6 is not useful at all for me. In A5 I need to find out ink pen friendly one. So cotton papers / low GSM handmade paper will not work. I have eliminated and selected 3 A5 notebooks for daily use.</p>
<p>I have also eliminated classmate unruled notebook, which I tried using for few days. I don&rsquo;t like cheap - shiny white paper. I like nice thick off-white paper.</p>
<p>In future I want to use <a href="https://www.rescript.in/?srsltid=AfmBOorVrgj4kqG322RJVqCgAAf8NkFOxEeke3y5q847bTjBV0IT5RiD">Rescript notebooks</a> again. Which is off-white, 70/80 GSM, recycled paper - available on Blinkit :)</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist myself so me and Nidhi went to <a href="https://curlytales.com/when-in-ahmedabad-visit-kalamkhush-handmade-paper-centre-and-see-how-handmade-paper-is-made/">Kalamkhush Handmade Paper Unit</a> on Saturday afternoon. It was long due wish to visit handmade paper unit. My intention was to get some notebooks for gifting and if I get something which is cheap and ink pen friendly, I will stock it. I bought 3 notebooks. They are reasonable in price but paper quality is not ink pen friendly. But it is ok for normal pen user.</p>

What are my triggers, what are my dislikes, what are my biases, what are the things I keep doing in loops, my thinking patterns&amp;hellip; when my ego pops up, when my anger slips in&amp;hellip; everything. I feel naked. I want to write all of this down in one separate notebook so I can start working on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This week was filled with profound realizations about myself and those close to me. I am discovering many things about myself when I am in a relationship, when I am with my partner. What are my triggers, what are my dislikes, what are my biases, what are the things I keep doing in loops, my thinking patterns&hellip; when my ego pops up, when my anger slips in&hellip; everything. I feel naked. I want to write all of this down in one separate notebook so I can start working on it.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> As I mentioned in my previous note, we have started naturopathy treatment. The next step was doing a sonography report of the abdomen. On Monday we went to the sonography clinic. The naturopathy doctor suggested a clinic which is run by a non-profit organization and their rates are very reasonable. They charged 800rs for the sonography test.</p>
<p>I took work from home that day and we went to visit Shreyas Foundation School. I wanted to buy books written by Leena Sarabhai about the school. But I couldn&rsquo;t get those in the library at Shreyas. They are not selling them. They are selling a very basic brochure-type book. I was very disappointed that day. I got to see the infrastructure and overall vibes of the school. That was also very, very inspiring. That day it was Leena ben&rsquo;s birthday so the children were preparing for a performance. I was so amazed by the song selection and preparation done by the children. For a second it felt like my imagination of Shantiniketan.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday to Thursday:</strong> As usual, I was busy with office work. Not getting much time and energy to do something in the evening.</p>
<p>I had a very bad headache on Thursday late evening, so we went to a nearby doctor. It was the wrong decision - we should have waited till morning. It was just because I didn&rsquo;t get enough sleep the night before. But we got scared that it might be because of a blood pressure issue.</p>
<hr>
<p>On <strong>Thursday</strong>, dear friend Nishtha came to facilitate a workshop at Tatvic office. Originally we both were going to facilitate that workshop but because of my office work I couldn&rsquo;t join her. Nidhi joined her and they both conducted the workshop on Friday.</p>
<p>Friday we had an IKS workshop on 64 Kalas. It was really nice. I have written my <a href="blog/64kala/">notes</a> on the same. I am really liking these sessions. I need to do some critical reading and make my understanding clearer. I need to push myself for it.</p>
<p>I read more about Waldorf education, history and timeline of influences on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a>. I found out his work is influenced by the Theosophical Society, Indian philosophy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">Goethe</a>&rsquo;s science and more. It is very interesting. I want to read Goethean things so I can make more connections.</p>

<p>I tried 2-3 fountain pens in the past. Apart from my Pilot V5/7 pens, I use them. In December 2024, Tultul gifted me a <a href="https://vsignpen.com/product/beena-antic/">&lsquo;Beena Antic Pen&rsquo;</a> and <a href="https://sulekhaink.co.in/product/green/">&lsquo;Sulekha Green Ink&rsquo;</a>. I loved using it. Beena is a very reliable pen with a 3-in-1 mechanism (Cartridge + Converter + Eyedropper).</p>
<p>I liked the green ink from Sulekha which is called Swadhin. But after using green color for the last year I got bored of it, so after short research I bought a <a href="https://www.parkerpen.com/inks-refills/ink-bottles/parker-ink-bottle/SP_1417120.html">Parker - Quink (Black) ink bottle</a>. It is superb&hellip; This changed my whole experience of writing. It is as dark as my V5 and smooth.</p>

<p>I was looking for a good stationery shop. A colleague from the office suggested <a href="https://skyblue.in/pages/ahmedabad-thaltej?srsltid=AfmBOoq689QOkn7sn-GS-qCheuZnGrPEJ9G8SQQ4b4ra5F0Zvm8FdaJv">&lsquo;Sky Blue&rsquo;</a>. One of the stores is very near my house, so I went there. I was about to go for an exploration ride but at that time the shopkeeper asked, &ldquo;What do you want sir?&rdquo; I said ink. &ldquo;What brand?&rdquo; Parker. &ldquo;Blue or Black?&rdquo; Black&hellip; &ldquo;90 rupees sir.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s it. I came back with the ink bottle. I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t go for exploration&hellip; otherwise my monthly budget would have gone out of the way&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> morning I had a Sanjhe Sapne team learning call. This time we talked about &lsquo;Health and wellbeing for team and students&rsquo;. After that we went to the naturopathy center. The doctor gave me a new diet plan which I need to follow from now onwards. Some medications are also there + I did mud pack and ghee massage treatment over there. I hope I get the strength to go through this journey. Outside food is so tempting - pani puri, ghughra, tea, sweets&hellip; but I will hold myself back. I will track it every day.</p>
<p><strong>BTW</strong> my social media consumption has reduced because I have deleted Instagram and YouTube from my mobile. So I only use YouTube when I am on my desktop and very rarely use Insta for some reference in the browser. I am so happy about this change. Sometimes I feel like opening Insta but now it&rsquo;s not on my phone so I go and read someone&rsquo;s blog or check WhatsApp statuses. It is still better than Instagram reels. I wish to delete short-form content from everywhere. I found out that there are short video songs coming on Spotify also which are very similar to Shorts.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the afternoon we had an <strong>art party</strong> at an office friend&rsquo;s place. I enjoyed it. I made one line drawing and one zine based on my poem. Other people made paintings with soft pastels, watercolors, acrylic colors and more. I enjoyed making a proper zine for the first time. I want to do it more. I also found a very interesting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zinedabaad/?hl=en">Insta page</a> around zine making. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ipsawonders/?hl=en">Ipsa Jain</a> also uses this medium for science communication.</p>
<p>We had home-cooked lunch together. After some time people started playing UNO. It&rsquo;s a game I hadn&rsquo;t played, so I kept myself busy with other things. I don&rsquo;t know, but there is a fear of judgment or something else&hellip; I am not able to enjoy games. Any type of competition or win/lose thing. The last time I tried was when I went to a game cafe with Malay. It takes effort from my side to make myself open to it. I need to work on this.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> morning we had a call with our friends who are looking for jobs or feeling stuck in their career. It is like a sangha. We help each other, share tools, ideas, opportunities. Help each other to identify their strengths, vision and clarity of thought. We call this group &lsquo;Kam-Kaj&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Nishtha went back to Goa. We couldn&rsquo;t spend much time because she went to meet another friend in the town. Saturday she was super tired and Sunday she was not feeling well so we just had lunch together and did a send-off to the airport.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nidhi did a tree walk with children at the learning center this week.</li>
<li>At Sakha, we both are not getting much time to get involved. But they are doing amazing sessions and projects. They did a special session on Krishna on Janmashtami. Apart from that they are visiting nearby villages to understand life over there. They have done 5-8 visits till now. Now they are figuring out how they can engage with youth or children from the village. They are working on one more project called &lsquo;unsung heroes&rsquo;, where they take interviews of interesting people.</li>
</ul>

<li>I need to do yoga regularly, so I need to save my energy in the evening so I can do it at 7pm with Nidhi.</li>
<li>No Insta and no YouTube is going good, I need to keep going</li>
<li>Strictly home food, as suggested by the doctor</li>
<li>Create an environment to read research papers and make notes.</li>

<p>Overall things are on a good note. I am enjoying work, home things seem to be a little more settled, and Nidhi and I are also learning more about each other.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to my office friends for their support and love.</p>
<p>Next week will be more focused on following the diet, working with children. On the weekend we are going to visit Mitali ben&rsquo;s school.</p>

It is for my stomach pain (while eating outside food, slightly spicy food, or some specific foods) and headaches (during evening time, after long screen time, or during high temperatures). The naturopathy center is very close to our home. It is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://vasantnaturecurehospital.com/&#34;&gt;Vasant Nature Cure&lt;/a&gt;. I was amazed after reading the history of this initiative. Really inspiring work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I have started my naturopathy treatment again. It is for my stomach pain (while eating outside food, slightly spicy food, or some specific foods) and headaches (during evening time, after long screen time, or during high temperatures). The naturopathy center is very close to our home. It is called <a href="https://vasantnaturecurehospital.com/">Vasant Nature Cure</a>. I was amazed after reading the history of this initiative. Really inspiring work.</p>
<p>I took my microscope to office and we had informal session with our team.. just exploring microscope, watching different things&hellip; our team enjoyed it. I think we should spend more time like this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tuesday to Thursday I was busy at the office, mostly working with children and other tasks.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was a long weekend: 15th August, Janmashtami, and Sunday.</p>
<p>This time we decided to celebrate Janmashtami at home. Nidhi was super duper excited. Initially we were planning to go to Dharmpur for a short trip and had even booked tickets, but we canceled the plan at the last minute mainly because I was feeling low and tired, not wanting to travel.</p>
<p>Friday we did prep for Janmashtami, and Saturday evening we celebrated it wholeheartedly. I invited a few friends but they couldn&rsquo;t join. One of my office colleagues / friend joined and helped us a lot with cooking and preparation of the whole thing. I am very grateful to her. I was so happy looking at Nidhi. She was super happy. She had a long-standing wish to celebrate Janmashtami at home, and I am glad that we could make this happen.</p>
<p>I have found one <a href="https://ahmedabad.chinmayamission.com/our-centre/">beautiful temple</a> near our home, where I can spend some quiet time after my office hours. I am planning to go at least twice a week.</p>

<p>Saturday morning, as usual, I attended my Indian Knowledge System online course. I am enjoying it. <a href="blog/iks/">Here</a> I made some basic notes about my understanding.</p>
<p>I am working on one project with <a href="https://www.sriviliveshere.com/">Srivi</a>, which is around Indian Aesthetics and education. I need to give more time to reading and researching for the same.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sunday we went to our office colleague&rsquo;s home. We had lunch there and spent the evening at the River front. We also visited <a href="https://www.instagram.com/navajivantrust/?hl=en">Navjeevan Publication Book store</a>. I bought two books:</p>

<p>We also visited the very interesting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNfxMKkv7Vc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">analog photography exhibition</a> at the same place.</p>
<p>I have realized that I am more drawn to poems, essays, and short stories or character sketches. I am not able to finish novels or long-form writing.</p>
<p>These days I am more interested in Tagore&rsquo;s work and philosophy, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to the book I brought about Tagore. I also like to write essays, so this time I am going to study from the other book, which is a compilation of essays from the best authors in Gujarati language.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are getting into a routine slowly. I am learning to &rsquo;let it go,&rsquo; release tensions and many unlearnings. I am trusting the universe. Slowly we will make sure that we wake up early, do yoga, eat healthy food, and work with a fresh and happy mind. What else is a happy life? For me this is the lifelong goal - to be in touch with your true nature and live each and every moment choicefully.</p>

<p>Nowadays I am only able to focus on my full-time work plus some research on IKS. All the other projects are kind of paused. I am taking it slowly. I am actually enjoying the work I am doing with children at my office. I am seriously thinking of shifting my focus to early childhood education and working more deeply in that area. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<hr>
<p>This month we spent beyond our budget on shopping and festival stuff, but it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="updates">Updates:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Next week Nishtha is coming for one workshop at Tatvic office. (we are doing it together)</li>
<li>Nidhi and I will go to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school at the end of this month.</li>
<li>Nidhi will be regularly going to the learning center and volunteering for an online course at Eklavya. She is going to visit Bhopal to attend an offline workshop of the same course in the first week of September.</li>

I was still writing last week&amp;rsquo;s note on Tuesday, and now the week is already over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent most of this week with the children. As part of my full-time work, I&amp;rsquo;ve become a regular part of the Kindergarten pilot program. I conduct hour-long sessions with the children every day from Tuesday to Friday. When I spend the morning with the children, the entire day becomes enjoyable, though I do get tired afterward. Making 30 children sing songs and do physical activities leaves me feeling a bit drained. It reminds me that I&amp;rsquo;m 30 years old now&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s still incredibly fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This week seemed to fly by. I was still writing last week&rsquo;s note on Tuesday, and now the week is already over.</p>

<p>I spent most of this week with the children. As part of my full-time work, I&rsquo;ve become a regular part of the Kindergarten pilot program. I conduct hour-long sessions with the children every day from Tuesday to Friday. When I spend the morning with the children, the entire day becomes enjoyable, though I do get tired afterward. Making 30 children sing songs and do physical activities leaves me feeling a bit drained. It reminds me that I&rsquo;m 30 years old now&hellip; but it&rsquo;s still incredibly fun.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Monday, Nidhi came to the office. All of us office friends gathered together and identified the biodiversity spread across our campus.</p>
<hr>
<p>Regarding office work - my office laptop still hasn&rsquo;t been repaired, so I have to think and write in a notebook. (I&rsquo;ve also deleted Instagram and other social media apps from my phone, which helps.) I often find that having a laptop with unlimited internet creates a kind of distraction.</p>
<p>Now, when I have actual work to do, I either ask to borrow someone else&rsquo;s laptop or complete the task on my phone. The laptop at home has essentially become a desktop, so even there - when I need to do real work, I connect to the internet through my phone and work on the big screen. The key is not taking your laptop and phone into the bedroom - that makes a huge difference.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last week I was considering something like publishing blog posts via email, but after talking with friends and doing some reading, I found a new and simple solution: prepare a markdown file in SimpleNote and copy-paste it into GitHub&rsquo;s mobile app. Cloudflare handles the rest. I also tried an app called Git Journal, but encountered some metadata errors, so I stuck with the workflow mentioned above.</p>
<p>This way, even if my laptop isn&rsquo;t available, I can at least update my website from my phone. Of course, I still need a laptop and Linux setup for editing themes and other technical work, but for blog posts (just text), this method works perfectly. I still need to figure out the best way to post images.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Friday evening, I went out for dinner with my office friends. It was enjoyable. The highlights of this week were definitely the time spent with kids and friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday - Raksha Bandhan: Nidhi enjoys celebrating festivals, and I thought it was a day off, we could relax&hellip; but we celebrated it in a small way. We made Shiro/halwa at home and ordered puri sabji from outside. We tied rakhi to each other, shared our feelings of gratitude with the universe, and prayed.</p>
<p>In the evening, I completed some work-related tasks and meetings, then went for a short ride on the Activa.</p>

<p>My health is fine now. Yesterday my blood pressure suddenly dropped, and I felt dizzy. I drank ORS which helped somewhat, but I still have a headache.</p>
<p>Today is mostly about rest and housework, with a little preparation for the work I need to do with the kids starting from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Today Nidhi successfully made dosa on the cast iron tava for the first time. (I forgot to take a photo)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="khojbin-mandali">Khojbin Mandali</h4>
<p>Nidhi conducted two sessions at the Learning Center this week.</p>
<p>In the first session, there was an activity about types of trees and how to identify them.</p>
<p>In the second session, she worked with the children to create a local map and mark trees on it - essentially making a tree map.</p>
<p>After conducting the sessions, Nidhi felt she needed to work on her voice projection, so we did some voice exercises together. I firmly believe that anyone working directly with children should do exercises similar to what actors do. I&rsquo;ll write more about this topic in a separate post.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="other-updates">Other Updates</h4>
<ul>
<li>I applied for an IPO for the first time and was successful. So that&rsquo;s my first stock investment!</li>
<li>After much thinking and experimentation, we&rsquo;ve decided to hire a cook for home. (We haven&rsquo;t quite figured out yet whether this is our laziness or a way to save time for other work :))</li>
<li>Nidhi ordered a study table from Amazon, but it hasn&rsquo;t been assembled yet. I figured that instead of struggling with it myself, I&rsquo;d get help from a carpenter.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re experimenting with following a routine together. Slowly, slowly&hellip;</li>
<li>Overall mood is good&hellip; happy, happy..</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="28th-july-to-3rd-aug-2025-monday-to-sunday">28th July to 3rd Aug 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>I am writing this weekly note on Tuesday evening from my bullet notes and publishing it with a backdate (2nd Aug). I put pointers in my simple note app about the week and finally elaborate on it on Sunday late evening to publish it, but many times I don&rsquo;t get time on Sunday to sit and do this task, so I do it on Monday or at the latest on Tuesday.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> - I was thinking of starting morning yoga at a nearby place, but finally we decided to join an online evening yoga class. It is difficult for Nidhi to wake up early and go for yoga class, and the yoga center doesn&rsquo;t have mixed-gender batches available in the evening - they only have female batches. So we settled on a YouTube live-based yoga class. The subscription is ₹3k for a year. They live stream new sessions every day; you can join morning or evening batches plus there&rsquo;s a WhatsApp community. It&rsquo;s nice. But the only thing you miss is live interaction because you can just comment on YouTube during live streaming. The yoga teacher won&rsquo;t be able to see your posture and guide you. You need to do it by yourself. The benefit is you get curated yoga sessions and a WhatsApp community which motivates/reminds you about the sessions.</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been looking for some app or online guided sessions for breathwork/meditation. I found something called <a href="https://still.ag/">Still</a>. But it&rsquo;s very costly for me. I like the founder&rsquo;s story. I tried attending one more guided session with different app, but the facilitator&rsquo;s vibe didn&rsquo;t match.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> - We watched &lsquo;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&rsquo;. Nidhi grew up watching Bollywood movies, especially Shah Rukh Khan films&hellip; she still loves watching them. I never got the chance and motivation to watch any of SRK&rsquo;s famous movies, so she&rsquo;s taking me through that <del>trauma</del> journey&hellip; I somewhat enjoyed the first half (after shutting my brain off).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> - At the office, I finally started working with children/taking daily sessions with kindergarteners. I&rsquo;m feeling so happy and grateful to the universe.</p>
<p>We met an educator friend in the evening at a cafe called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafenativestories/?hl=en">&lsquo;Native Stories&rsquo;</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong> - I met with a small accident while going to the office. I was trying to cross the road on my Activa when a bike rider hit me. I got a jerk, and because of the weight of the helmet, my neck&rsquo;s soft tissue muscles got damaged. It took three days to get back to normal. I took medicines plus the support of a neck belt.</p>
<p>Now, the more interesting part: while this happened, my laptop bag fell down from the Activa onto the road. Before I could pick it up, someone drove a car over that bag. Both my home laptop and office laptop got damaged. Both are ThinkPad laptops - one has an aluminum body and the other has a carbon body. The office laptop&rsquo;s (aluminum one) screen got more damage. The home laptop (carbon) also got screen damage, but it&rsquo;s just a small crack and flickering screen. Very bad day&hellip; but somehow I managed.</p>
<p>Right now my office laptop is in the ICU. I&rsquo;m using my home laptop as a desktop with my LG monitor. It&rsquo;s working pretty well. I&rsquo;m surprised how this machine survived after a car went over it.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> - Took the day off from office because of the pain. Spent time with Nidhi, planning activities to do at the learning center.</p>
<p>Nidhi started volunteering for a course called - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLFGy-JI5dn/?img_index=2">Education for Dialogue, Maitri and Justice (by Prof Aman Madan, Ruchi and other facilitators)</a>. She&rsquo;s going to attend all the online sessions and an in-person workshop at Bhopal - Eklavya campus.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> - Took the day off from work. Did morning yoga with Nidhi. Started a learning project with <a href="https://www.sriviliveshere.com/">Dr. Srivi Kalyan</a> around Aesthetics Education for educators and primary grade children. I will share more details soon.</p>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s session got cancelled, so we went to Manek Chowk and explored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_(housing)">Ahmedabad&rsquo;s pols</a> and did some shopping.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Sunday was a hectic day. In the morning, we organized an online meeting for our friends working in the development/education sector who are looking for jobs or better career opportunities. We heard all the points where they feel stuck and tried to share some ideas, insights, and frameworks about how to approach this whole thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Large-scale organizations give good money, but the work isn&rsquo;t meaningful</li>
<li>Cities have better job options, but lifestyle is better in villages</li>
<li>I want to work directly with children, but field people or ground-level people get less salary while management people get more</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know what skills I have</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know what type of roles I can do</li>
<li>How to find work-life balance, how to find meaning in work</li>
<li>How to judge an organization before joining it</li>
</ul>
<p>Many more queries&hellip;</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I spent time with my dear friend <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/hss/fac-malay">Malay</a>. In the evening, I went with him to a board game cafe in South Bopal called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/one20mins/">&lsquo;One 20min Hub&rsquo;</a>. We were a group of five (Malay, Mihir + Malay&rsquo;s friends), and we played 3 games. I tried and enjoyed playing board games for the very first time.</p>
<p>I feel a little anxious in vocabulary-based games. We played &lsquo;Codenames&rsquo;&hellip; I made mistakes but still somehow managed&hellip; enjoyed it. I wish I had better English vocabulary.</p>
<p>Apart from that, we played Carcassonne and Splendor. Enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Apart from all of this, I thoroughly enjoyed talking with Malay about philosophy, aesthetics, games, and life&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>Nikita di sent really good books about Shree Ramana Maharshi from Tiruvannamalai. Really thankful to her.</p>
<p>I got a new idea to add to this website. I want to do something like an &rsquo;email to blog post&rsquo; feature. What if a laptop isn&rsquo;t available? I can just email to a specific email ID with the content of weekly notes, and some script triggers, copies that content - makes a .md file - puts it in the relevant folder of the GitHub repo and pushes it - Cloudflare Pages will build the Hugo site and publish it. I tried doing it with the help of ChatGPT, but it&rsquo;s pretty complex for me. I need some help. I will try it again.</p>
<p>I got new borsil water bottle as a gift from Tanu :)</p>

<hr>
<p>This week was healing for me. There were ups and downs, but overall it ended on a good note.</p>
<p>Monday to Friday was mostly office work. Soon I will start taking sessions with children apart from sitting at my desk and working on my laptop.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wednesday &amp; Thursday - Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school - Kanisa (Khambhat) for taking sessions with children. It went well. She is going to continue this engagement. She will go to take sessions once a month.</p>
<p>I feel so happy to see Nidhi taking sessions with children and spending time with teachers. She is in her real avatar when she is with children and teachers who love her. I wish she gets more and more opportunities to spend time with lovely people and nature.</p>
<hr>
<p>Friday I went to physiotherapy for my back pain. It was unbearable. Physiotherapy gives temporary relief, but I need to do regular exercises. I must join a regular yoga class. Waking up early is a little bit difficult for me - I have spoiled myself. But I will definitely join the 7am yoga class batch and see how it goes for a month.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday &amp; Sunday were fully packed.</p>
<p>Saturday I attended two workshops from the office: &lsquo;Indian Aesthetics&rsquo; and &lsquo;Games &amp; Activities for Neurodivergent Children&rsquo;. I enjoyed attending the Indian aesthetics workshop. It is validating my personal educational philosophy, which is mostly inspired by J. Krishnamurti, Martin Buber, and a few other philosophers.</p>
<p>I published a blog post on <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/indian-art-aesthetics/">Indian Art &amp; Aesthetics</a> after listening to Udayan Bajpayee&rsquo;s lecture.</p>
<p>I had my regular learning call with the Sanjhe Sapne team. It is going well.</p>
<p>We went to the park in the evening and had a good 30-minute walk. Nidhi took a bath in the rain in the evening - she enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sunday morning we had a good walk at the park and breakfast.</p>
<p>We tried making our daily schedule and list of projects in hand.</p>
<p>Sunday evening was wonderful. We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iktara.shabad/">&lsquo;Shabad Parikrama by Hardik Dave&rsquo;</a>. It was a long-held wish and dream to go to this event with Nidhi. She didn&rsquo;t understand all the Gujarati verses, but she still enjoyed the overall vibes. I am very grateful to Hardik Dave and his team for organizing events like this. Please explore his Instagram to know more about his work.</p>
<p>My grandfather was a bhajanik - he was running a bhajan mandali. Hardik&rsquo;s work reminds me of him.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have ordered a study table for Nidhi. It arrived, but we need to assemble it.</p>
<p>I observed that my Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn feeds are all filled with posts about &lsquo;people working on laptops&rsquo;. I was looking for inspiration where someone is working with children and sharing their process, behind the scenes, struggles&hellip; I see that an educator&rsquo;s process is like an actor&rsquo;s process.</p>
<p>Adulting is at its peak - we are discussing everything about cooking, washing, shopping, and many household things.</p>
<p>I reached out to two or three people with requests for interesting learning projects. All replied in a positive manner. Let me process it. Hopefully something interesting and meaningful is coming up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, things are okay. I am also in a better state of mind. I am planning to make a mood board at home about my work and inspiration. Ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>I took off from the office Monday to Wednesday. It helped me a lot to stabilize myself and somewhat handle the situation while taking care of myself. I am very grateful to my team for being supportive.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="khojbeen-mandali-update">Khojbeen Mandali Update:</h4>
<p>I went to Nidhi&rsquo;s learning center on Tuesday evening. We are still doing pre-tests with children. Hopefully, we will start the intervention from next week.</p>
<hr>
<p>Mahendra sir was in town for two days. He called and we met for dinner on Wednesday. It was nice as usual—discussions about educational philosophy, teacher education, and life in general. He introduced us to a nice South Indian restaurant near Gujarat Vidyapith.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thursday : We went to see &lsquo;Metro in Dino&hellip;&rsquo;. I liked the movie.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Friday evening, office colleagues made a spontaneous plan and came home. We had chai, ghughra, and made a nice dinner—dal chawal, began sabji&hellip;</p>
<p>It was really nice to forget everything and be with friends, enjoying the moment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday was busy with a workshop/course I&rsquo;m attending from the office on &lsquo;Indian Aesthetics&rsquo;. Slowly, I&rsquo;m starting to get the hang of it. I&rsquo;m able to make connections. I used to have these types of discussions with Mahendra sir. I want to deep dive into this and do something tangible with it in the classroom with children.</p>
<hr>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been part of formal college education, so I&rsquo;ve felt the need over the years to find learning opportunities beyond professional, outcome-driven roles. I long for a phase where I can simply be a student again. I wish to take a break from my full-time job for 2-3 months. During that time, I want to do something (facilitation/assisting someone in writing a research paper) around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of environmental aesthetic sense in children, especially from an Indic perspective</li>
<li>Exploration of the affective domain, connecting it with Rasa theory</li>
<li>Project-based and integrated learning approaches</li>
<li>Something related to neuroscience, environment and aesthetics</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me manifest it. If you are reading this and know someone related to this, please connect me.</p>
<p>On one side, I&rsquo;m interested in working with older children/teenagers through projects, helping to develop self-directed learning spaces. On the other side, I like working with younger children on the topics mentioned above.</p>
<p>I need to think about the long term—what will be useful for making my career more sustainable. This is a very capitalistic thought&hellip; where I have fear about my career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to choose paths without any fear when you&rsquo;re married, in your 30s, when the world is moving at super-fast speed. I have an understanding partner; we&rsquo;re ready to support each other, but still&hellip; I never thought this way when I was alone, but now it&rsquo;s by default.</p>
<p>I just started earning some money after so many years, and suddenly I want to take a break to pursue a deeper learning journey. There should be some support system for these types of sabbaticals&hellip;</p>
<p>I just remembered that I never take intentional vacations or travel without any agenda since I&rsquo;ve been working. From age 18, I&rsquo;ve been constantly working—job after job, place after place—proving myself, working with children, teachers and organizations, learning new things, trying to establish myself in this fast-moving world.</p>
<p>I want to use the break to just be&hellip; without any agenda&hellip; heal myself&hellip; love myself more.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Sunday, we went to Vadodara. I facilitated a creative writing workshop with Sakha fellows. It was a super hectic day. We started at 9:30 in the morning and came back around the same time at night. We spent almost 6 hours traveling for a 3-hour workshop. But we enjoyed spending time with young people, exploring poetry and other forms of writing with them. I will write a separate post about the same.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to stay back in Vadodara to rest and come back the next day.</p>
<hr>
<p>This week I said no to one freelance project. It was related to developing modules around climate action mindset and career paths for middle school children. It was an interesting subject, but right now I don&rsquo;t have the time or mental stability to sit and work on this project along with my full-time job. Nidhi is also busy with other projects. I am very grateful to the people for trusting and supporting me for this.</p>
<hr>
<p>A friend and I are working on experiential learning / game-based workshops with corporate employees. It&rsquo;s new for me. I&rsquo;m learning how to facilitate Gen Z employees through games :)</p>
<hr>
<p>What else? I&rsquo;m trying to stabilize myself. Finding my grounding&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to travel anywhere this month. I want to be at home, go to the office regularly, focus on a few things.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to the therapist after the first session. I&rsquo;m rethinking the same—should I go or not? I want to find alternative ways to heal myself.</p>
<p>Things will get better&hellip;</p>
<p>धीरे-धीरे रे मना, धीरे सब कुछ होय । माली सींचे सौ घड़ा, ऋतु आए फल होय ॥</p>
<p>I wanted to write this weekly note in Gujarati but I restricted myself, because many friends/readers are not from Gujarat. I don&rsquo;t want to trust Google Translate for my Gujarati :) but I will definitely start writing other posts in Gujarati soon.</p>

Mom is with us. My mental health is at its worst. I am taking a break from office work (still doing other side projects slowly) and working on my self. This family matter is taking too much out of me. Not able to focus on any projects/work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-july-to-13th-july-2025-monday-to-sunday">7th July to 13th July 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>The first half of the week went mostly in office work.</p>
<p>I have visited Vadodara for a family matter. Mom is with us. My mental health is at its worst. I am taking a break from office work (still doing other side projects slowly) and working on my self. This family matter is taking too much out of me. Not able to focus on any projects/work.</p>
<p>It is ok, it is a phase. It will also pass. I wish friends could come to visit us. I am feeling very alone. We, me and Nidhi both need support.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, have the luxury to work from home/take leave from work. Please do come to visit us in Ahmedabad. Spend time with us without any agenda.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am very proud of myself that I am committed to weekly notes. Week by week documenting the journey, reflecting&hellip; just putting out words there also gives me relief&hellip; this is my medium of sharing&hellip; sharing a piece of life. Sometimes it puts me in trouble also when I put some sensitive info out there but it is ok. I am learning. I don&rsquo;t want to censor so much. I read Divya&rsquo;s weekly note. The way she expresses gives me hope.</p>
<p>Thejesh shared some very interesting stuff about &lsquo;weekly notes&rsquo; in his latest weekly note which I liked so much. So sharing here again :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blog post by James - <a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write">&ldquo;More People should write&rdquo;</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excerpt from the book <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674057579">&ldquo;Field Notes on Science and Nature.&rdquo;</a> which describes the nature of weekly notes:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking time to write out an idea or observation forces us to pause and consider. Recording the daily unfolding of experiments—their success or failure—encourages an honest assessment of how each day&rsquo;s work fits within the underlying goals and theory of the project. It takes time to create a narrative of experiments, events, and observations, but it eventually pays dividends because it forces thorough examination, which is a common characteristic of science across disciplines. In Darwin&rsquo;s description of the marine iguana, for example, we can imagine him on board the Beagle, penning his zoological notes and pondering the origin of their &ldquo;apparent stupidity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Resources on nature journaling:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://johnmuirlaws.com/journaling-curriculum/">How to teach nature Journaling</a>
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/clare-walker-leslie/keeping-a-nature-journal-3rd-edition/9781635862294/">Keeping a natural Journal</a></p>
<p>I will write my experience with nature journaling and teaching natural journaling to educators and children in a separate post.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wanted to build a social media feed kind of page on my blog for a long time. Just like Twitter feed with short text or image. I saw an example of that on <a href="https://sylvia.bearblog.dev/status/">Sylvia&rsquo;s website</a> and tried making it for my Hugo site with the help of ChatGPT. Finally made the basic version which I like. I will share the link after I put something on it. I will also try to create a different RSS feed for that.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me tell you this, do you know some people go to their favorite shows/books/places when they are low or stressed. I go to my favorite blogs/weekly notes. Specially <a href="https://thejeshgn.com">Thej&rsquo;s blog</a> and <a href="https://kartikm.wordpress.com/">Kartik bhai&rsquo;s blog</a>. I read old posts. At Kartik bhai&rsquo;s blog I read his reports about DebConf or other FOSS conf/meetups (Wikipedia, OSM, blogger community). It is very refreshing for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday &amp; Sunday was little happening. I had a call with Sanjhe Sapne team, mentoring call with Earth Educator fellow, and I attended one office work related online workshop.</p>
<p>Sunday I met dear friend Malay after few months. We talked about many interesting topics.
One thing I shared with him was the disappearing of open source/FOSS communities. Few years ago there were communities of Wikipedians, OSM people, bloggers, Linux meetups&hellip; nowadays there are very few meetups in cities like Ahmedabad and Vadodara. Nowadays I see meetups around AI and AWS :) which is ok&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know I like more of the old stuff :)</p>
<hr>
<p>I need to prepare myself for working with children. Need to do some robust planning, some theater activities for self to get into the zone&hellip; I need to leave these screens and be more with myself.</p>
<hr>
<p>I started reading again, very slowly I am picking up&hellip; finished last few chapters of the book called &lsquo;Electric Train&rsquo;. I am going to pick the book called &lsquo;Rakhdu no kagad&rsquo; (which I already read in the past) again. Going back to familiar things&hellip; this is the phase right now.</p>

<h4 id="health">Health</h4>
<p>This week was difficult. My mental health is in a very bad phase.
Over the last few months, I somehow managed, but now it’s hitting me hard. I’m not able to concentrate on work.
Feeling anxious, being zoned out, sleep cycle disturbed. I’m feeling that everything is meaningless.
I’ve started therapy. Let’s see how it goes. It’s costly, but at this point in time, I want to invest in my health.
I am very grateful for Nidhi&rsquo;s support.</p>
<p>We bought health supplements for both of us long back, but haven’t started taking them yet.
Yesterday, Nidhi made a nice poster with the timings and names of the supplements.
So… let’s begin!</p>

        decoding="async"
        width="800"
      />
    </picture>
    
  </figure>



<p>I want do yoga regularly, wish me luck !!</p>
<p>Nidhi has been unwell for the last few days. Stomach pain — maybe because of outside food in this weather. She’s better today.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="personal-website">Personal Website</h4>
<p>I’ve made some changes to my website hosting setup. I started with a GitHub repo + GitHub Pages, where I edited my files on my local machine, built the Hugo site, and pushed it to the Git repo. It got published on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Cloudflare Pages, where I edited and built the Hugo site and pushed the public folder to CF Pages.</p>
<p>I have different machines at the office and at home. In the CF Pages setup, I wasn’t able to edit my site during my office chai breaks.
Sometimes I get ideas, and I don’t want to wait until I sit at my personal laptop to publish them. So I went back to GitHub.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve put all my content files on the Git repo, and CF Pages builds the Hugo site automatically. Now I can edit my files on the Git repo from the browser.
I tried using Git through the command line, but my office laptop is Windows, so it was difficult. It didn’t even understand some file names — some error came because of that.
WSL is not allowed to download, so finally, the browser was my saviour.</p>
<p>I was concerned about the repo size because I publish images in every weekly note.
I’m using Hugo’s image optimization shortcode which converts images into WebP, resizes them, and makes them responsive — so I’m hopeful.</p>
<p>In short, now I can log in to GitHub and edit my site (very basic functions like adding a new post or editing an existing post).</p>
<p>btw I have added small little black dot as favicon :)</p>

<p>Jitu (one of the members from our Sakha community) visited us on Friday. He studies Electronics and Communication at LD Engineering College, Ahmedabad. We talked about AI, programming, life, nature, climate change, and what not… We had nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXKNCSkVweU">Jamnagri Ghughra</a> near our home and took a lovely walk at Eklavya Sports Campus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jamnagari Ghughra is a savory, fried pastry from Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, featuring a spicy potato and pea filling. It&rsquo;s a popular street food, often enjoyed with spicy and sweet chutneys. The dish is known for its crispy outer layer and flavorful stuffing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nidhi made wonderful dhokli today… it reminded me of mom.
(Dhokli is a traditional Gujarati dish — wheat flour dumplings simmered in a tangy, spiced lentil curry. Comfort food at its best.)</p>

<p>We watched <em>Sitare Zameen Par</em> on Monday. It was a nice film. I just wish the narrative had been a little subtler—it felt too direct for me. But still, it&rsquo;s a really important subject that needs to be talked about in mass media.</p>
<p>For the first time, I tried kneading roti dough—with Nidhi’s help. I wasn’t confident at all, but somehow, I managed. I want to explore this more. This week Nidhi made some awesome pasta and experimental bharva taroi sabji :)</p>
<p>On Friday, we facilitated a session on <em>Nature-Based Learning</em> with research and curriculum team at my office. We both enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Saturday evening, we went to Priti Ben’s place. It was rainy, but we enjoyed the metro ride.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we visited a nearby sports campus called <em>Eklavya Sports Academy</em>. It’s a lush green space. We went for a morning walk for the first time. As expected, Nidhi got completely engaged in observing trees and greenery—she was more interested in looking at trees than walking! But still, we managed a nice 3–4 rounds of walking. After that, we went to <em>DVG Benne Dosa</em>. The food was nice but a little pricey. We had ghee masala dosa and palak paddu. We always look for good, authentic South Indian places. After living in Bangalore, we can’t eat dosa at just any regular place. In Gujarat, dosa and sambar are something else altogether. I want to make a list of places in Ahmedabad where you can eat good dosa.</p>
<p>In the evening, we watched a Malayalam film called <em>Hridayam</em>. It was a beautiful film, though it felt a bit long—it runs for 2 hours and 51 minutes.</p>
<p>This week, I also listened to some old Gujarati songs and watched Marathi short film.</p>
<p>This weekend, we had a negotiation around time. Nidhi wanted to spend more time with me, while I wanted some alone time. We somehow figured out a temporary middle path.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I’ve been daydreaming about something strange—I’m dreaming of getting admission into a university. I’ve never been a full-time student at a college or university. I started working when I was 19. Now, I feel this strong craving to live as a student—without tension, experimenting and researching new ideas&hellip; a curiosity-driven life.</p>
<p>I’ve been re-reading the PhD thesis of <a href="https://1derful.org/">Jay Silver</a>(Makey Makey, MIT Media Lab) and wondering if I could also write something about the <em>learning experiments</em> I’ve done with children and teachers over the past 12 years. How my philosophy of education and life has changed. How my understanding of learning has evolved. I want to document and reflect on all my past projects.</p>
<p>Academia scares me with its rigidity, but these days I’m thinking more about independent research—something related to nature education, experiential learning&hellip;is there something like a <em>practicing PhD</em>?</p>
<p>Sometimes, I also feel like doing something entirely different from education. I feel saturated. At times I think I should move into the livelihoods sector or ecological restoration—maybe work with farmers&hellip;</p>
<p>Or maybe I should take a break and just focus on writing, doing theater, learning music, studying design, aesthetics and philosophy —something for the soul. Not for money. Not to prove anything.</p>
<p>My relationship with money is also changing radically. Now, I spend without overthinking. I don’t ask whether something is expensive—I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it useful?</li>
<li>Is it solving a real problem?</li>
<li>Is it sustainably made?</li>
<li>Is it an impulsive buy, or something I truly need?</li>
<li>Even if it’s impulsive, is it eco-friendly or socially just?</li>
<li>Do I want to support this kind of business?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if I’m buying a pair of chappals made from sustainable materials, designed well, and if the brand promotes justice—and if I can afford it—I won’t obsess over the cost. I mean, I won’t judge it <em>only</em> by the price.</p>
<p>Even with all this reflection, I’m still in a grey zone. I’m not very clear about my relationship with money right now. From childhood, we’re taught to save, to not spend much on things or experiences. But once you start earning, once you live in a city, your relationship with money shifts.</p>
<p>What if I want to eat 200 benne dosas in Ahmedabad? I’ll buy them. Food should be good. Living spaces should be good. Spend money on books, travel, meeting people, hosting friends, sending gifts&hellip; doing experiments&hellip; everything that nourishes your soul.</p>
<p>My mental health hasn’t been great. I’ll seek help soon.
My back pain has returned—possibly due to driving and sitting too much. I need to start exercising again and using a hot bag.</p>

<p>This week was not very hectic, but not too slow either. Overall, it was a good week, work-wise.
On Monday and Tuesday, we spent time with the Nature Classroom team.</p>
<p>Nidhi visited Mumbai to facilitate a workshop. She felt very confident while facilitating the session and really enjoyed it. I felt so happy seeing her journey as a facilitator/educator. I’m so grateful to be a small part of her journey, and that she is part of mine.</p>
<p>On Saturday and Sunday, I spent time finishing small tasks that had been pending for a long time—giving feedback, replying to emails, and more.</p>
<p>I enjoyed working on my desk</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I had a call with two of my friends to discuss their learning pathways and career paths. In the development sector—especially when you&rsquo;re working with an NGO in the education space—your growth is not always predictable or linear. It’s not like the corporate world, where you get promotions at regular intervals.
What if you want to remain an educator, continue working directly with children, and still grow in other aspects of life—money, new skills, new kinds of learning, or new types of projects?
What if you don’t see “Project Manager” as your next goal?
What should a growth pathway look like that gives you enough challenges to stay inspired, helps you feel meaning in your work, and shifts as you move through different life phases?</p>
<p>I have developed a questionnaire for personal reflection. Whenever I consider changing my job / taking new project, I ask myself these questions. This time, I shared them with friends who are also looking for clarity and new ideas. Let’s see if it helps. Let me know if you’re interested in a framework to think about your next move—I’d be happy to share it. We can even have a one-on-one call to brainstorm and explore together.</p>
<p>This framework includes reflecting on your personal philosophy / values, strengths, interests, learning aspirations, financial needs, and cultural/social/emotional needs. It&rsquo;s also useful for documenting your past work and building your portfolio.</p>
<p>I’ve been sharing some thoughts on self-directed learning and portfolio-making with the <em>Sanjhe Sapne</em> team. We&rsquo;re having weekly learning calls, and I’m enjoying them so much.</p>
<p>I’m also working with the YouCAN – Earth Educator Fellows, sharing my insights about working with children and developing programs. I’m learning a lot from each one of them. As an alum of this fellowship, I feel very grateful for the opportunity to stay connected with like-minded and like-hearted people.</p>
<p>A big part of my work revolves around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing tools and creating environments for self-directed learning</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel the need to start documenting my frameworks and ideas—maybe that will be the topic for my next blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="sakha-fellowship-updates-">Sakha Fellowship Updates :</h4>
<p>Sakhaz are working on two projects. One is an inquiry project around rural/village issues. They’ve prepared a survey form and visited a village near Waghodia. The second project is about interviewing unsung heroes. They started by interviewing a 100-year-old <em>masi</em> who runs a <em>sev-usal</em> shop in Vadodara.</p>
<p>We both feel so happy seeing the updates, but unfortunately, we haven’t been able to engage with the Sakhaz in person. We only get Saturdays and Sundays off — and those are usually packed with our other project meetings, home maintenance work, and a bit of downtime. That’s also when the Sakha team meets in Vadodara.</p>
<p>Technically, Vadodara is just 3 hours away, but it takes us 1 hour just to get to a place from where we can catch a bus. We’d need to leave work early on Friday evening, and we don’t have a place to stay in Vadodara either. So, all of this makes it really difficult… but we’ll find a way to join in somehow.</p>
<p>We really miss the energy and connection with the Sakhaz.</p>
<hr>
<p>The rest of the week was mostly filled with office work.
This week was also filled with some existential questions—
Is my work worth doing?
Am I on the right path?
What is my relationship with money, and with my employer?</p>
<p>I don’t know why, but I feel like I’m in a phase of life where my ambitions to “make it big” or “be successful” in the conventional sense are getting quieter. I’m okay with slow and small now.
What’s calling me more is building meaningful relationships—with peers, friends, partner, family, the larger ecosystem and support system. I want to invest in that, rather than chasing individual success. Supporting friends in finding their paths, doing projects together, sharing ideas, contacts, networks, resources—without guarding them. Meeting people without agendas. Just being grateful and feeling enough—for who I am and who others are.</p>
<p>I’m slowly becoming less aggressive about pushing my own ideas—trying to learn the art of listening, of understanding other perspectives.</p>
<p>Over the last few months—conflicts at home, changing dynamics at work, and the deepening of my relationship with my partner—have all changed me.
Maybe it’s just age.I have turned 30 this May.</p>
<p>I was also feeling anxious during parts of this week because of some work tasks, but somehow I managed. Writing and journaling help—they slow down my thoughts and help me feel calm.</p>
<p>I’m considering therapy to work on my overall mental health, which has been affected by multiple things over the past few months.</p>
<p>Anyway… it was a good week.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I watched an old Marathi web series and listened to some beautiful, slow Hindi and Marathi songs.</p>

<p><strong>I remembered this beautiful poem by my dear friend Hemant Deolekar:</strong></p>
<p><strong>पेड़ों का अंतर्मन</strong></p>
<p><em>हेमंत देवलेकर</em></p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>कल मानसून की पहली बरसात हुई</p>
<p>और आज यह दरवाज़ा ख़ुशी से फूल गया है</p>
<p>खिड़की दरवाज़े महज़ लकड़ी नहीं हैं विस्थापित जंगल होते हैं</p>
<p>मुझे लगा, मैं पेड़ों के बीच से आता-जाता हूँ</p>
<p>टहनियों पर बैठता हूँ</p>
<p>पेड़ों की खोखल में रहती हैं किताबें</p>
<p>मैं, जंगल में घिरा हूँ</p>
<p>किंवदंतियों में रहने वाला</p>
<p>आदिम ख़ुशबू से भरा जंगल</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>कल मौसम की पहली बारिश हुई</p>
<p>और आज यह दरवाज़ा</p>
<p>चौखट में फँसने लगा है</p>
<p>वह बंद होना नहीं चाहता</p>
<p>ठीक दरख़्तों की तरह</p>
<p>एक कटे हुए जिस्म में</p>
<p>पेड़ का ख़ून फिर दौड़ने लगा है</p>
<p>और यह दरवाज़ा बचपन की स्मृतियों में खो गया है</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>याद आने लगा है</p>
<p>किस तरह वह बाँहें फैलाकर</p>
<p>हज़ारों हथेलियों में समेटा करता था</p>
<p>बारिश को</p>
<p>और झूमने लगता था</p>
<p>वह स्मृतियों में फिर हरा हुआ है।</p>

<p>This will be a short note. Nothing much happened this week.</p>
<p>We celebrated International Play Day at the office, and it was super fun! The office team asked our relatives for our childhood photos and made a beautiful collage. It was really, really enjoyable to recognize each other from childhood photographs. We played games and shared our childhood memories.</p>
<p>One of our close friends came to spend time with us at our place. I feel very wholesome when someone comes to spend time with us without any specific agenda—cooking together, eating together, talking, sharing ideas, taking a walk together. That gives me warmth and makes me feel loved.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I&rsquo;m realizing that spending time with friends, family, and loved ones is what&rsquo;s truly interesting. I should do it more. One part of myself always leans towards interesting projects, but now I want to consciously choose the projects and people I work with, as well as my working patterns. I want to invest my time and energy in spending time and having interesting experiences with loved ones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also wondering why people aspire for job stability or working long-term in one organization. It&rsquo;s because it gives you security and belonging—you get time and mental space to think about other things in life. When you stay at one organization and remain in one place (city or town), you make connections with that city. It would be wonderful to have friends nearby. Living close to your dear friends is a bliss.</p>
<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t feel connected to Ahmedabad. I felt connected to Vadodara, Bhuj, and Bangalore. I need to make more effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling very grateful to the universe. We&rsquo;re both getting very nice work opportunities. I&rsquo;m working with organizations and projects, directly or indirectly, that I&rsquo;m really aligned with. Sometimes it&rsquo;s overwhelming to work on too many projects, and I get anxiety, but it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m learning to manage it.</p>
<p>We started an online yoga class, but it&rsquo;s not working well. In a week, we only did it for two days. It&rsquo;s not a live class—they&rsquo;re doing YouTube live with interactive chat. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I wish to start some legitimate sports activity like cycling, swimming, or running.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now regular with breakfast, making very simple things like ragi malt with milk and dry fruits, or oats.</p>
<p>I bought Kesar mangoes from our office&rsquo;s mango orchard. They are so yummy! We made aam ras and loved it.</p>
<h2 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates:</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to combine two weekly notes, but there&rsquo;s no option now—it&rsquo;s too late. The last two weeks were super happening, but I&rsquo;ll keep it short here. Sunday is almost gone and too many work tasks are pending.</p>
<p>Let me start with this: I miss BLR. Weather, food, people—everything&hellip; I follow specific people on Twitter just to take in Bangalore vibes.</p>
<p>26th &amp; 27th went into office work. We took a flight from Ahmedabad to Bangalore on the 28th morning, reached there by afternoon. Met Thejesh for the first time. It was nice to have a chat with him about life, work, food, and other stuff. When you read a person&rsquo;s weekly notes, you feel you already know them.</p>

<p>We visited a friend&rsquo;s place in HSR, freshened up, met another dear friend Jubin, had dinner, and caught the bus for Coonoor. Reached early morning.</p>
<p>We were unprepared for Coonoor&rsquo;s weather (no sweater, no proper footwear for the rocky terrain). We borrowed a sweater from someone and somehow managed.</p>
<p>Spent 5 days with amazing nature educators who came from all over India &amp; the YouCAN team. It was a mix of feelings—it gave me a sense of belonging to the community that I am an alumni of this fellowship. In some moments it gave me self-doubt, and in other moments it gave me profound inspiration.</p>

<p>We met dear friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theearthlynotes/">Adithi Muralidhar</a> at Coonoor. I did my internship under her at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education - Design &amp; Technology Education lab, Mumbai.</p>
<p>While coming back, we again halted in BLR, met Ruchir, the Nature Classrooms team, and folks from Nature Conservation Foundation. Visiting Nature Classroom&rsquo;s office, meeting the all-girls team, and seeing their amazing work gives me happiness, hope, and inspiration. Someday I want to build a space/org like this in my native place.</p>

<p>3rd June - we&rsquo;re back in town—Ahmedabad.
4th I did work from home. 5th I went to the office.</p>
<p>I got sick on the 6th. Suddenly got fever and loose motions&hellip; it was food poisoning. Still recovering. I don&rsquo;t know how I got it—maybe because of traveling or outside food or heat, don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m thankful that it&rsquo;s not covid. I&rsquo;m feeling better now.</p>
<p>No reading during the last two weeks.</p>
<p>Music : We sang nice songs during the campfire at the fellowship residency. That night is memorable.</p>
<p>Overall mood is happy but a little stressed because of too many pending tasks at the office and also from other side projects.</p>
<p>Sakha fellowship work is going well. Ashish bhai and Rameshwari ben are leading it very well. Today me and Nidhi attended one team meeting, and we got some new updates.</p>
<p>Sakhas are taking up new projects. One of the groups wants to start a podcast for unsung heroes from daily life, one group wants to visit villages and explore the issues over there. Me and Nidhi are thinking to meet them and help them convert their project into a <a href="https://media.nationalgeographic.org/assets/file/Educator_Guide_Geo_Inquiry_Final_2.pdf">geo inquiry project</a>. Anyone interested in developing and documenting geo inquiry projects with children, please let me know. Happy to collaborate. We&rsquo;re also planning to host sessions on financial literacy, gender, and youth-life-related stuff. No motivation or gyan. Real problems of youth and exploration for the same.</p>
<p>Otherwise, everything is going well. I need to catch up with a few friends and do proper planning for the side projects.</p>
<h3 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates:</h3>
<p>Dear friend Siddhartha helped us make the final logo of KBM. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple and cute logo. Chappal is part of the logo because our central idea is exploration and inquiry, and what&rsquo;s a better medium to do exploration than &lsquo;walk&rsquo;!! So the chappal (footwear) :)</p>
<p>We also launched our Instagram handle on 5th June—World Environment Day. Check it out here.</p>

Let me tell you, I really, really love my Pilot V7/V5 pens. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I lost it—I used to lose it when I worked in schools. I generally use my Pilot pen to make notes in notebooks. I love the smoothness of the writing experience that comes with liquid ink. The V7 has a refill cartridge. I have Hi-Tech Point Pen ink, which I put into the cartridge and use the pen again. This can be done 3 to 4 times. After that, ink overflows from the joint near the nib.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>This week was super hectic, and the coming week is also going to be hectic as we&rsquo;re traveling to Coonoor for the Earth Educator Workshop and meeting people in Bangalore.</p>

<p>This week started by losing my Pilot pen. Let me tell you, I really, really love my Pilot V7/V5 pens. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I lost it—I used to lose it when I worked in schools. I generally use my Pilot pen to make notes in notebooks. I love the smoothness of the writing experience that comes with liquid ink. The V7 has a refill cartridge. I have Hi-Tech Point Pen ink, which I put into the cartridge and use the pen again. This can be done 3 to 4 times. After that, ink overflows from the joint near the nib.</p>
<p>I prefer black ink over blue or other colors. I also have other ink pens for which I use Sulekha Swadeshi green ink.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, Nidhi found the lost pen in one of my shirt pockets.</p>
<hr>
<p>I finally cleaned my laptop&rsquo;s fan. I ordered a screwdriver from Blinkit, watched a video on YouTube, and opened the back cover of my super light ThinkPad Carbon. I observed that there was no heat sink paste remaining on the processor, so I decided to buy paste from Amazon and apply it myself.</p>
<p>It was around ₹500 to ₹1000. I searched for local shops and asked for rates. Finally, a very nearby shop did it for ₹300.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nidhi made thali pith. We wanted to make something tasty and fast. A friend suggested this, and Nidhi made it nicely on her first attempt. She was super happy.</p>

<hr>
<p>I had an online learning circle call with the Sanjhe Sapne team. We&rsquo;re going to have this call every month. I&rsquo;ll share more about it some other time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Office colleagues came home on Wednesday evening. We had homemade cold coffee and lots of talking. We want to host friends and serve healthy drinks like ragi malt, hibiscus tea, aam panna, and sattu.</p>
<p>Nidhi made idli sambar. Now we feel at ease making idli sambar. We still need to buy a cast iron tava for dosa. Any good recommendations?</p>
<hr>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s friend from Azim Premji University came to our home. We both feel very happy when someone comes to our place just to stay without any agenda, to spend quality time. It&rsquo;s a privilege to get time to go to your friend&rsquo;s place and just stay.</p>

<p>Friend gifted us <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jhajistore?igsh=bHltcnFxZWN4ZXFn">Mithila based homemade pickles</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Friday evening we left for Vadodara. We spent our weekend with children and the Sakha Fellowship team. We had wonderful filmmaking with children.</p>

<p>Weekend traveling was hectic. We took an AC Volvo bus. It was super expensive—a normal bus is ₹100 and Volvo is around ₹320—but it was helpful in this heat and with back pain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="khojbeen-mandali-updates">Khojbeen Mandali Updates</h2>
<p>I had a call with Adhvan about developing a map module. I want to develop activities where children can connect to their own place—town—city. Knowing local plants, trees, vendors, systems, being part of citizenship activities, heritage, conservation, using senses, walking.</p>
<p>Something like: Re-imagining Maps - Explore the science and art of cartography through conversations about maps and interactive mapmaking. This is an invitation to renegotiate how we interact with landscapes, how we understand maps, and how we document the spaces we occupy and the lives we live within them.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends shared an address of a famous Hindi author, which comes with a footnote after the main address:</p>
<p>🌱 (कटोरा तालाब मुख्य मार्ग में बूढ़ी मां मंदिर तक आना होगा। मंदिर के सामने मुख्यमार्ग में माँ शारदा होम्योपैथी दुकान के बाजू की सड़क पर अंदर आखिरी घर है।)</p>
<p>🌳 अंदर आने वाली सड़कों पर बोर्ड लगे हैं। जिस बोर्ड में कटोरा तालाब सड़क नंबर 11 लिखा है, उसी सड़क पर अंदर आना होगा। दाहिने ओर का सबसे आखिरी घर है।</p>
<p>घर के अंदर एक आम का पेड़, घर के बाहर एक ओर मौलश्री के दो पेड़ और दूसरी ओर सप्तपर्णी, मौलश्री, करंज के पेड़ भी रहते हैं। साथ में गिलहरियां, चिड़ियां और हम सब भी।</p>
<p>Are we connected to our place apart from Google Map locations? What Google Maps shows are commercially active places like malls, petrol pumps, shops—not trees, small shops, small landmarks, small water bodies. Anything that&rsquo;s not generating money is not on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Can we design our own maps? Can we use maps as a tool to connect with ourselves and the places we live in? Can this become an activity module?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super interested in this project. Let me know if you want to collaborate in any capacity.</p>
<p>Another project I want to work on is &lsquo;fostering wonder and awe&rsquo; in children&rsquo;s lives, very much inspired by the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacher_Keltner">Dacher Keltner</a>. I want to work with children from 3 to 11 years of age.</p>
<p>Read: <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2024.1229029">Wonder-Full Hearts: Awe Turns Children into Caring Champions</a></p>
<p>I actually struggle to keep these two personalities—one which is very playful, curious, and storytelling while working with little children, and suddenly shifting to social justice, connecting with place, and citizenship ideas while working with older children or educators. I keep shifting between these. But ultimately everything is the same&hellip; be playful, curious, walk slowly, and wonder more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="social-media-usage">Social Media Usage</h2>
<p>I consume Instagram, which shows me mostly artists, photographers, writers, and nature lover profiles and posts. Posting on Instagram is getting less frequent. I want to put selected weekly note photos on social media regularly, but it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>I consume LinkedIn, which shows me mostly people and posts from the development sector. I&rsquo;m literally fed up with that.</p>
<p>Twitter shows me mostly developers and entrepreneurs from Bangalore.</p>
<p>Apart from all of this, I really enjoy reading weekly notes from different people. I use a feed reader to track and read weekly notes from selected people.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall mood is happy.</p>
<p>My reading is paused again. I&rsquo;ll try to resume it in June.</p>

Not getting time to write my weekly note on Sunday and finishing it on Monday is getting difficult. I want to write in detail but I&rsquo;m not getting the mental space.</p>
<p>I got a new laptop from the office - a ThinkPad E16.
It is heavy, runs Windows, has a big screen,
and battery backup is good.</p>
<p>The first few days I was not ready to leave my Carbon and shift to this because of my set workflow. But according to office policy, I needed to, so finally I moved.</p>
<p>My Carbon is giving me little problems nowadays. The venting system in X series is not that great. In Ahmedabad&rsquo;s heat, the fan of my machine is going mad. On the other side, the E16 is working smoothly.</p>
<p>I asked a few friends - they said there must be dust in the fan which needs to be cleaned, and I should avoid tasks with high CPU usage. I will clean it and see.</p>
<hr>
<p>From Monday to Wednesday, we had a storytelling workshop by Vikram Sridhar at our office.
On Tuesday, we went to The Calico Museum of Textiles as part of the workshop.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad is called a &lsquo;World Heritage City&rsquo; and it has 30+ museums. I never saw this city through a heritage lens.But now both Nidhi and I have decided to see this city through this lens. We want to start by going on heritage walks, visiting museums, and being part of the theater culture here.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tuesday we watched a film called &lsquo;Bangalore Days.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a nice, fun film in Malayalam. We watched it with subtitles. Nidhi recommended this film; she watched it a few years ago and she really liked it.</p>
<p>We also finished the film &lsquo;Angoor,&rsquo; which we had started watching earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summer break at school, so our canteen is closed. That means I need to prepare food at home and take a lunch box. For me, waking up early and making food is difficult. Same with Nidhi. I can do reading, writing, and other kinds of work in the morning, but not cooking. Nidhi is helping so much with cooking lunch and breakfast. Slowly, I have also started making breakfast. So now in the morning, we both are stretching ourselves and preparing food.</p>
<p>Nidhi is also experimenting with dinner and snacks. She loves cooking and experimenting with food. She&rsquo;s basically a foodie. I am cognitively very interested in food but slowly getting interested in the hands-on part of it - I mean cooking. For me, it&rsquo;s a long way to go. I know basic cooking like making khichadi, sabji, dal-chawal&hellip; I need to learn roti. Most importantly, I need to learn how to use the kitchen neatly.</p>
<p>Apart from this, we both want to constantly work on our diet because of our sensitive stomachs. Especially my stomach, which is very sensitive. The doctor told me that it&rsquo;s like the stomach of a 6-year-old. So we both need to remind ourselves to eat at home and eat millets, fruits,things with less masala.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday, we started watching a web series called &lsquo;Very Parivarik&rsquo; by TVF. It is a very relatable show.</p>
<p>On the same day, we had a long conversation about spending quality time with each other. For both of us, quality time means different things. Example : For Nidhi, it&rsquo;s cooking together, and for me, it&rsquo;s discussing ideas/brainstorming together. So we made a list of things and shared with each other. We also made a kind of timetable to fit everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>We went to Aarambh Cafe on Saturday evening. I was craving good sambar. Actually, Kamla Cafe, Aarambh Cafe, Kasturba Cafe, Atithi Restaurant, and Thepla Sabji from Gajanand - these are places that serve food which we can eat without worrying about our stomachs.</p>

<p><strong>We discussed Khojbeen Mandali activities. Some updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of our friends from Eklavya Foundation, Melody, wrote an article on &lsquo;Development of Aesthetic Sense in Primary Grades Through Nature-Based Activities&rsquo; which got published in a journal by Azim Premji University. I was part of this project, creating activities and mentoring the facilitator. Now we are planning to publish this work in other magazines like Sandarbh, Vikalp Sangam, and Nature Classrooms blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Nature Classrooms book &lsquo;There Is Nothing There,&rsquo; which Nidhi translated into Hindi, we are collaborating with Eklavya Foundation to print it in Hindi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are inviting Tanaya from Nature Classrooms to come to Ahmedabad. She will be observing pilots about nature education assessment tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are conducting a local Khoji film-making camp this coming weekend (23rd to 25th May)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tried developing a logo and visual identity for Khojbeen Mandali with a few friends. We gained some clarity about what we want during the process. We&rsquo;re going with what I made initially. One more friend is helping to make it better. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll get something interesting in the next few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coonoor trip for Earth Educator Workshop. (28th May to 3rd June 2025)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Sunday we went to Vikram Sridhar&rsquo;s storytelling performance at Scrap Yard. We enjoyed driving the Activa at night on surprisingly less trafficked roads.</p>
<p>I spent time coordinating with the team for the local Khoji camp.</p>
<p>I started reading again but am not getting uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="5th-may-to-11th-may-2025-monday-to-sunday">5th May to 11th May 2025 (Monday to Sunday)</h4>
<p>It was my birthday week. I never celebrated birthdays explicitly in my childhood or even in my adulthood - no cake cutting, no party. In school, May 9th was mostly vacation time. In adulthood, I worked in schools, so again I had vacation during that time. At home, mom used to make my favorite food &lsquo;vedhmi&rsquo; / puran poli. I never got a chance to celebrate my birthday with friends. I remember celebrating once with my Eklavya office colleagues, friends, and participants.</p>
<p>But this time was different. Nidhi and friends made it super special.</p>
<p>Apart from that, this week was full of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness because of the political situation in the country and the situation at my home. I messaged my friends in Bhuj to check on them during blackout days. Got news about the ceasefire and very soon after, the breaking of that ceasefire.</p>
<p>At home, also ceasefire happened; we involved some other family members too. Mom went to Padra on Sunday. Let&rsquo;s see how long this ceasefire lasts&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> was a regular office day. There was a storm in the evening. It was raining at night. Nidhi made wonderful cold coffee in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> I worked from home. My stomach was not well.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> I also worked from home because of rain. We went to Teapost, Sindhu Bhavan Road in the evening.</p>
<p>We received the <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/2025/05/07/nagarathna-memorial-grant-2025-results/">Nagarathna Memorial Grant</a>. We will use the grant money for the local khoji camp coming up at the end of May.</p>
<p><strong>On Thursday</strong>, we set up paintings. Now this home feels like home.</p>

<p>Buying plants and setting up composting is still pending.</p>
<p>Me, Bansi, and Nidhi went to Kamla Cafe for dinner and walked back home.
We had a chat about life until late night.</p>
<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>We started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215517/">Angoor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>Nidhi and I read a small book about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenu_Kuruba">Jenu Kuruba Tribes</a>.</p>
<p>The Jenu Kuruba are a tribal group from the Nilgiris, numbering around 37,000.They are concentrated in the districts bordering the states of Kerala and Karnataka.
&lsquo;Jenu&rsquo; means &lsquo;honey&rsquo; in Kannada, referring to their traditional occupation as collectors of honey in the forest.</p>

<p>I forgot to take photo of Bhindi kadhi</p>
<p>On Sunday, we made idli sambar. I tried my hand at making sambar following Nidhi&rsquo;s instructions. It turned out nice for a first attempt.</p>
<p>We went grocery shopping at a superstore. We reflected on how we&rsquo;re becoming disconnected from local kirana stores and small businesses. We&rsquo;ve started referring to malls and superstores as &ldquo;Maya Bazaar.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re going to try finding ways to purchase more items from kirana stores—less superstore shopping, less Blinkit ordering, and less Instagram-influenced purchasing.</p>
<p>Nidhi did some trial English-to-Hindi translation work for NCF outreach. If selected, she&rsquo;ll be doing translations related to nature and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Setting up our composting system and buying plants are still pending. Time seems to rush from one task to another, leaving me feeling neither rested nor free from the tension of uncompleted tasks.</p>
<p>It was enjoyable having lunch and dinner together on Saturday and Sunday. We often feel the urge to watch something while eating. We&rsquo;ve started watching old shows like &ldquo;Vikram Vetal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Byomkesh Bakshi.&rdquo; We try to select shows that Mom can also enjoy.</p>
<p>We watched the Gujarati film &ldquo;Reva.&rdquo; Though Nidhi and I had seen it before, we watched it again with Mom.</p>
<p>Nidhi is collecting seeds from the fruits we&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>I started taking ragi malt for breakfast and am loving it.</p>
<p>Mom is okay. Things are on hold. Let&rsquo;s see what happens next.</p>
<p>We want to launch an Instagram page for our nature education/experiential learning initiative. We&rsquo;ve named it &lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali,&rsquo; embodying the spirit of curiosity, wonder, and inquiry. A bunch of friends are helping us create a logo and Instagram templates. I could have started with the basic elements I already have, but I&rsquo;m really enjoying the process of crafting an identity and translating ideas into visuals. This has been the highlight of my week, along with, of course, the delicious food prepared by Nidhi and Mom. I&rsquo;m very grateful to them.</p>
<p>We are going to Coonoor for a workshop at the end of the month. We&rsquo;ve booked our tickets. We&rsquo;re also planning to spend one day in Bangalore to meet friends. We are very excited about this trip.</p>
<p>This week involved no reading apart from office work, and no music either. I need to get back to reading.</p>
<p>Overall mood : I am ok, not in much stress. I am trying to keep my self calm and happy.</p>

<p>This week was again a roller coaster ride. Too much is happening. I am not getting the mindspace to write this weekly note in detail, so I am just putting down pointers.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal office day. After a long weekend, all teammates gathered and had a nice catch-up.</p>
<p>Tuesday I took leave. Nidhi and I went to Vadodara. Mom came back with us. The home situation is not well.</p>
<p>We had a clay workshop in the office. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions with children at the learning center are on pause because of summer vacation. They will resume in June. Nowadays, she is working on developing project-based nature education modules for grades 6 to 9.</p>
<p>Mummy was sharing about having difficulty in reading. Nidhi and Mummy went to Lenskart and got a new pair of glasses. Lenskart made the whole eye test and spectacle buying experience very smooth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.earthfocus.in/">Earth Focus</a> team sent a copy of &lsquo;Stop, Look and Wonder,&rsquo; their nature education curriculum. I had the opportunity to review the curriculum while they were developing it last year.</p>

<p>I watched this podcast again to get inspired by the wonderful work they are doing:</p>

<p>The Papon concert got canceled due to the Kashmir incident. Both the artist and organizer decided to cancel it, and we got a full refund. It was going to be our first concert experience.</p>
<p>We bought a big plastic drum to start our composting journey. We still need to get soil.</p>
<p>At the office, we hosted a nature education session with children. Nidhi also joined for it. I am so glad and grateful that she could come. She is always a big support and inspiration for me. I am very grateful to my office team also for initiating and being part of it.</p>

<p>I played &lsquo;Cards Against Humanity&rsquo; for the first time. It was horrible! :) But I enjoyed games that are language-heavy, where you need to make jokes, play with vocabulary, and talk in metaphors. I will write in detail about this in another post.</p>

<p>Finally, we bought a 70L cooler from Vijay Sales. We wanted to buy from a local manufacturer/non-branded cooler because it&rsquo;s cheaper, but we couldn&rsquo;t find any shops selling them. So finally, we went to Croma but didn&rsquo;t get good rates. Eventually, we bought it from Vijay Sales.</p>
<p>We have two bedrooms, and we tried setting up the cooler so both rooms get some cool air, allowing us to avoid using the AC. It worked, but we need to keep doors open all night. We&rsquo;re thinking about buying one more small cooler or using the AC in the bedroom&hellip; let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is we didn&rsquo;t get a pipe and noseal in nearby shops. We went to a nearby mall (Mr. DIY), but the pipe was very expensive there. Finally, we found an option on Blinkit that we need to order. I continuously feel that we&rsquo;re getting disconnected from the local ecosystem because of this apartment lifestyle.</p>
<p>Saturday, Nidhi, Mom, and I went to Kamla Cafe for dinner.</p>
<p>Sunday, we had a call with our financial advisor to understand health insurance. It was very interesting to learn how it works. The process to claim insurance is getting stricter because of the many frauds happening in the country. We also had a short discussion about registering our own trust / NGO to facilitate our work with children. Two three already suggested the same thing but we are still thinking about the idea.</p>
<p>I had a call about storytelling and setting up a library space with a teacher working in Kendriya Vidyalaya. She is doing storytelling with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankittellsstories/?originalSubdomain=in">Ankit from TISS Mumbai</a>.</p>
<p>The home situation is getting worse. I am in constant stress and anxiety. Let&rsquo;s hope things get better in the coming week.</p>

I published my last note on the 16th. I could have published a combined note for weeks 15 &amp;amp; 16, but I didn’t want to miss anything while combining them.

<p>My weekly note cycle got affected because of travel. I published my last note on the 16th. I could have published a combined note for weeks 15 &amp; 16, but I didn’t want to miss anything while combining them. Combining two weeks felt like a ‘very long time’, and I wanted to be there with my fellow weekly note-writers… so here I am with weekly note 16/2025.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I went to the office after a week-long break. There were very few people from our team because of the long weekend.</p>
<p>My back pain returned. I was standing and tried to pick up something from the floor when it hurt terribly. I just got to the fridge, and Nidhi helped me with an ice pack. It worked.</p>
<p>On Friday, we spent time decorating our home with small items we have, like fridge magnets and some toys. The paintings are still waiting to be framed.</p>

<p>Nidhi made a bandhanwar.</p>
<p>Our Activa wasn’t starting. We tried repeatedly and finally went to a nearby garage. The mechanic put in a new battery, serviced the brakes, and changed the engine oil. Now it’s running very smoothly.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went to CEE. We visited a new shop called InStore and tried to visit CEE’s nature shop, but it was closed. We went to Aarambh Cafe and had hibiscus tea, dosa, and uttapam.</p>

<p>I like the sambar from this place. The hibiscus tea was costly but we enjoyed it. We ate out a lot last week, so we decided to work on getting back into our cooking rhythm.</p>
<p>InStore’s curation was super cool; I really liked their collection of origami lamps, ceramic wind chimes, and other items. I was amazed at how “eco-friendly,” “organic,” and “sustainable life” products have been commercialized. Nidhi mentioned after seeing the products that we could make these at home. But do we have the time? Do we have the skills? And again, do we have time to invest in developing these skills?</p>
<p>On Saturday, we conducted a natural color-making workshop with children at the Tatvic office. Nidhi led the session. It was fun!</p>

<p>I cleaned my laptop with isopropyl alcohol. It looks nice now, and I enjoy working on it more.</p>
<p>We went out to find materials for Sunday’s workshop. We wanted plastic straws for making “toys from trash” (Arvind Gupta toys). Surprisingly, we didn’t find plastic straws in stationery shops, Mr. DIY, or shops selling disposable items. Everyone is selling steel or paper straws. We couldn’t find plastic straws at all, which was interesting! Anyway, we only checked around the Thaltej area, so geography matters.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we conducted another workshop on “Fun with Science”/toys from trash with children at the Tatvic office. We made a balloon rocket, which didn’t work for some reason. We did two more interesting experiments that amazed the children. They shared lots of ideas about how those particular things work. I’ll try to write a detailed post about this.</p>

<p>We ordered a helmet from Amazon—a Vega Atom. It’s a nice, compact, lightweight helmet. I like it. Now I can drive more confidently.</p>
<p>we are now using AC on daily basis. We are getting habitual, which we don’t want for multiple reasons.. environment, money, health.. we are thinking to buy small cooler.</p>
<p>The situation at home is bad again. I get anxious whenever someone calls me from there. I really don’t know how to handle this. I feel helpless. Last week everything was ok, suddenly things changed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="7th-april-to-16th-april-2025-monday-to-wed">7th April to 16th April 2025 (Monday to Wed)</h4>
<p>This time I am a little delayed in writing my weekly note. This week was super busy.</p>
<p>Monday was a normal work day at the office.</p>
<p>I made a very basic version of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voicesofvishwamitri/?hl=en">VoV</a> website on WordPress. I need help in curating content and page design ideas. I&rsquo;m not getting enough time to work on it.</p>
<p>Tuesday &amp; Wednesday we had a &lsquo;storytelling workshop&rsquo; at the office by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_storytellingfellow/?hl=en">Vikram Sridhar</a>.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, we left for Bhopal. Nidhi got a confirmed ticket because of tatkal booking, and I got an RAC ticket (I booked it a few days ago). Finally, we slept on Nidhi&rsquo;s seat and gave the other seat to the RAC fellow. It was a tiring journey.</p>
<p>Eklavya is our second home. Whenever we go there, we meet our close friends and colleagues. This place is super welcoming - welcoming you, your ideas; it&rsquo;s not just a workplace but a family for nomads like us. We share everything with each other, from personal life to work life.</p>
<p>This visit was special because we were visiting Eklavya for the first time after our wedding. We got lots of gifts &amp; hugs from our friends there. I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>Almost every day we went out to eat with friends, which was the best part of the trip.</p>
<p>Thursday: During my last visit, I tried <a href="https://myfoodstory.com/burmese-khow-suey-recipe/">veg khow suey</a> at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amerbakeryhut.bhopal/?hl=en">Amer Bakery, Bitten Market</a>. This time also we went there with friends and had it. I loved it.</p>

<p><strong>Khavsa: Gujarat connection of Khow Suey</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://curlytales.com/surats-khavsa-is-the-distant-cousin-of-burmas-khow-suey-know-about-its-interesting-history/">Khavsa</a>, a popular Gujarati street food, traces its roots back to Burma (Myanmar), where it is known as Khow Suey. The dish&rsquo;s journey to Gujarat is linked to the Memon community, who had strong trading ties with Myanmar. They adapted the Burmese Khow Suey to Gujarati tastes, resulting in the spicy, textured Khavsa we know today.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bought new footwear from Bata. It was long overdue. I didn&rsquo;t think much - went into the showroom with the idea to buy sandals but came out with Bata Quovadis chappals. They look like Birkenstock, but the build quality is very different. Overall, I liked them. They&rsquo;re very comfy and go well with my overall look, which is mostly cotton shirts with cotton cargo pants.</p>

<p>Friday: We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/icecreamfactoryindia/?hl=en">Shahi Durbar</a> and had wonderful mango &amp; guava ice cream. Had dinner at <a href="https://www.indiancoffeehouse.com/">The Indian Coffee House</a>. I&rsquo;m always fascinated to learn about the history and co-operative model of ICH. This time I learned more about its history from a friend and also read something on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Indian Coffee House chain has a significant historical connection to leftist movements, particularly the Indian Communist Party. During the 1950s, the Coffee Board&rsquo;s decision to shut down the chain sparked a workers&rsquo; revolt led by communist leader A.K. Gopalan, which ultimately led to the coffee houses being handed over to worker cooperatives. This event solidified the coffee house&rsquo;s identity as a space for left-leaning political activity and discussion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I realize why ICH isn&rsquo;t present in Gujarat!</p>
<p>Saturday: We went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theten.in/?hl=en">The10</a> with all friends from the &lsquo;Child Development Course&rsquo;. We had a continental dinner - pasta, burrito bowl, broccoli risotto, nachos&hellip; I don&rsquo;t often consume this type of food. It was very new to me. I especially enjoyed the burrito, nachos, and falafal.</p>
<p>I shared my life updates with friends in detail. I was surprised that a few of them were regular weekly note readers. Meeting with friends, cracking jokes, sharing life updates was the best part of the trip. I am really, really grateful for all the friendships I&rsquo;ve made in this life.</p>
<p>Sunday: Nidhi and I went to &lsquo;Swadeshi Handicraft Mela&rsquo; with another group of friends. We heard from another friend that it&rsquo;s very affordable and interesting. I had the impression that handicraft melas are expensive, but we found very affordable and cool cotton shirts (ikat prints, block prints), Chikankari kurtas, cargo pants, and more. We also met some artisans from Kutch and bought handmade cushion covers from them. We also bought a wooden key stand. It&rsquo;s cute but was an impulsive and costly purchase. We spent more than 5K but got an amazing stock of clothes, especially for me because I don&rsquo;t easily find cotton cargos and shirts at this price. Nidhi also got some interesting items for herself.</p>
<p>Monday: We gave an ice cream treat to all the course participants. In the evening, we screened &lsquo;Laapataa Ladies&rsquo; in the workshop hall. Most of the audience was female. It was a nice experience to watch it together.</p>

<p>Tuesday: It was the last day of the workshop, and we tried to meet everyone in the office. Had short meetings with Tultul and Rajesh. We planned a course review meeting for next month and discussed some writing/publishing projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article about project-based learning experiments done with children by Nidhi and me</li>
<li>Some articles written by Mahendra sir on aesthetic sense development and other topics like affective domain in education</li>
<li>Translation of the book <a href="https://www.natureclassrooms.org/theres-nothing-there-book">&lsquo;There is Nothing There&rsquo;</a> (Nature Classroom) in Gujarati</li>
<li>Getting books from CEE for Pitara</li>
<li>Collaborating with Yuvan Aves to publish his books/articles/poems in Hindi</li>
</ul>

<p>we bought books from Eklavya Pitara store for our office &amp; some selected nature related story books for Nidhi&rsquo;s sessions at learning center.</p>
<p>We took a train to Ahmedabad on Tuesday night. On the opposite berth, there was a 4-5 year old child with her parents. I asked her if she wanted to listen to a story from big book. We ended up exploring &lsquo;Saljam&rsquo; together as we traveled.&quot;</p>

<p>Wednesday: We are back in Ahmedabad. I will join the office tomorrow. This week will be busy. We have a summer camp at Ravi bhai&rsquo;s office on Saturday-Sunday. I am going to take a one-day session with a school associated with our office.</p>
<p>We made progress on our financial planning front. We bought health insurance for both of us. It was tough to think about, compare the plans, and figure out if it was the right decision or not. Our friend, a financial advisor, helped us a lot by listening, clarifying our doubts, and reassuring us.</p>
<p><a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/education/central-government-trying-to-scrap-bachelor-of-elementary-education-course-of-delhi-university-and-bring-in-integrated-teacher-education-programme/article66965018.ece">I got to know that Delhi University&rsquo;s B.El.Ed course is shutting down</a>. Two of our faculty members are associated with the same course. It&rsquo;s sad to hear about this. It&rsquo;s the most comprehensive course I&rsquo;ve seen for teacher education, with a nice balance of practice and theory.</p>
<p>This time during the child development workshop, I was observing other faculty members - how they take sessions, how they go slow, explaining concepts with examples and analogies. I do the same, but sometimes I hurry, don&rsquo;t go deeper, give monologues, don&rsquo;t use the blackboard effectively, and just talk.</p>
<p>They facilitate deeper understanding of concepts, whereas I sometimes jump straight to classroom application.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;ve come a long way with my facilitation style. I will keep all this in mind for the next workshop.</p>
<p>Today I had my first mango of this summer - &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banganapalle_(mango)">Banganapalle</a>&rsquo;.
For dinner we went to atithi restaurant for aam ras &amp; roti :)</p>
<p>Mummy is doing okay. She took Papa for an eye checkup. We found out that Papa needs to undergo cataract surgery. They found a hospital where they perform the surgery for free. I need to take leave from the office and accompany them for this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hegde_seema_/">Seema</a> started writing <a href="https://seemateeta.blogspot.com/2025/04/week-15-of-2025-sunday-to-saturday.html">weekly notes</a>. She is Horticulturist 👩🏻‍🌾❤️‍🔥, Phytophillic ☘️ living in a village called Hosalli in Sirsi, Karnataka. She writes about farming, gardening, books and other stuff.</p>
<p>I am realizing that I am an attention seeker, egotistical person. I want to be in the good books of everyone, I always want to prove my point and be on top&hellip; in my universe I am at the center. What should I do to be grounded? Listening is one thing I want to focus on from now onward.</p>
<p>Last year, Nidhi translated a book called &lsquo;There is nothing there&rsquo;. Now it is available as printed copy. You can buy it from <a href="https://ncf-store.zohocommerce.in/products/there-s-nothing-there-hindi/1638627000002181312">NCF Store</a> / download it as pdf from <a href="https://www.natureclassrooms.org/theres-nothing-there-book">Nature Classroom Website</a> (There is very interesting game based on this book, check it out !)</p>

It is my favorite sabji. I love how my mom makes it. We tried our best to make it edible&amp;hellip; the taste wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly like mom&amp;rsquo;s, but it was nice. It was fun cooking together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>We made drumstick sabji on Monday evening. It is my favorite sabji. I love how my mom makes it. We tried our best to make it edible&hellip; the taste wasn&rsquo;t exactly like mom&rsquo;s, but it was nice. It was fun cooking together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mukherjiantara_art/?hl=en">Antara</a> gifted us nice paintings as a wedding gift. I gave one of the paintings for framing. I realized that wooden frames are quite costly. I&rsquo;m waiting to see how it will turn out.</p>
<p>I went to physiotherapy on Thursday. My height + long sitting hours + 20 to 25km of everyday driving on Activa + no exercises have all contributed to lower back pain and shoulder pain. I also started some basic stretching, applying ice packs, and taking breaks from sitting. I am in a much better state right now, but the pain is still there.</p>
<p>We had a call with <a href="https://www.youcan.in/">Ram - Rachita</a> on Friday. I was so happy to see them on screen after a long time.</p>
<p>We took on a nature education curriculum/module development project for grades 6 to 9. There is already wonderful work and content creation happening by <a href="https://palluyirtrust.org/">Palluyir Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.ncf-india.org/">Nature Conservation Foundation</a> (early bird, nature classroom, season watch), Wipro Earthian, and more. We are trying to curate and make it more contextual. Let&rsquo;s hope we create something meaningful.</p>
<p>I have developed and now manage two schools&rsquo; websites on <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. It&rsquo;s a nice, easy-to-use platform for basic stuff. This year they increased the price of their basic annual hosting plan from 2,338 Rs to 3,540 Rs (18% GST included). I think this is too much for our use case. Changing the platform and transferring the content is a task&hellip; let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t had the mental space to work on the &lsquo;Voices of Vishwamitri&rsquo; website. I need to focus on it this week.</p>
<p>Nidhi completed 4 sessions at the learning center. She is taking two sessions per week. Both the children and Nidhi are enjoying the sessions. I will ask Nidhi to share her documentation link so I can share more about the sessions.</p>
<p>Mom is at Padra. One week has passed. I talk to her on the phone almost every day, but I still miss her presence.</p>
<p>Next week on Wednesday, Nidhi and I will leave for Bhopal - Child Development Course at Eklavya. It will be a busy week. I am excited to meet all the friends.</p>
<p>I wrote a post on <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/tantra-in-day-to-day-life/">Tantra Vidya</a> in Gujarati based on Subhash Bhatt&rsquo;s video.</p>
<p>Today, we had a meeting with a financial advisor to start our investment and tax planning journey. It feels weird sometimes&hellip; we are now adults thinking about tax, investment, medical care, yoga subscriptions, and health supplements. By the way, let me know if you have any recommendations for protein powder and multivitamin supplements.</p>

<p>I am still reading &lsquo;Tilor&rsquo;. The story is progressing slowly, but the plot is very interesting, so I am continuing it. I may read &lsquo;Mane Fom Chhe&rsquo; in parallel.</p>

<p>I feel that I am constantly fighting. Fighting with &lsquo;convenience&rsquo;. Or fighting for convenience?</p>
<p>I lose every day&hellip; every hour&hellip; every minute.</p>
<p>In Ahmedabad, 39 to 40°C was the average high temperature last week. I feel guilty every time I switch on the AC in my room. I get images of fruit vendors, delivery people, and others in my mind. How are they living? I press the remote finally and keep the AC on for about 30 minutes or so&hellip; I start feeling anxious&hellip; &ldquo;The electricity bill will be high&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I doing the right thing?&rdquo; I switch off the AC, open the window, and try to acclimatize.</p>
<p>Last night I woke up in the middle of the night&hellip; I was sweating&hellip; it was too hot even at midnight. I switched on the AC&hellip; but my sleep was gone&hellip; I was fighting&hellip; fighting for convenience.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I had a discussion with Nidhi about not using plastic bags in the fridge to separate vegetables. We can use something else&hellip; or even spend time separating them when we want to prepare food. But she feels anxious if things aren&rsquo;t in place. Are we that busy? I think yes, we are busy&hellip; should I blame the system?</p>
<p>We took some cloth bags and transferred the vegetables into them.</p>
<p>Our composting project is still waiting for our attention. Hopefully in the coming week.</p>
<p>One part of me dreams of a day where I only do mundane, day-to-day work like cooking, washing utensils, cleaning, and more&hellip; if someone were to pay all my bills. Would I really thrive living like that? Would I eventually feel the urge to do something &lsquo;more meaningful&rsquo;? What if I don&rsquo;t create any value or meaning in my life?</p>
<p>What should we make for dinner? For breakfast? It&rsquo;s a daily question&hellip; On Saturday evening, we went to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kamla_sewa/?hl=en">Kamla Cafe</a>. During dinner, we were talking about &rsquo;taste&rsquo;. How generation by generation we are losing the taste&hellip; taste of traditional food, fruits, vegetables&hellip; Maggi masala and tomato ketchup are taking over all our taste buds&hellip; things are changing very rapidly. Another part of my being says, &ldquo;Organic stuff is very costly&hellip; it is another scam of capitalism&hellip; Maybe one day I will have my own farm? How can I support a larger ecosystem for sustainable farming practices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of my friends, Chetan (a KA Shala alumnus), is selling milk and other organic products. I have known him for years and can trust the quality of the products he sells.</p>

<p>I bought tickets for a live concert by Papon in Ahmedabad. This will be our first concert experience. I was reading FAQs on the site and realized that we can&rsquo;t take water bottles with us, just because they want to make money by selling packaged water bottles and creating tons of plastic waste. Very disappointing.</p>

<p>This week was hectic again. Meetings, calls, outings and work.
I am having shoulder, neck and lower back pain. It feels like my body hasn&rsquo;t rested for months. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I daily travel 20 to 24km on my Activa. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of stress? It&rsquo;s more painful than I thought. I need to figure out some exercises to get rid of this.</p>
<p>After a year of writing weekly notes, I&rsquo;ve developed some guidelines :</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be selective about what I share publicly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office details remain private, though I can mention celebrations like Holi or special events</li>
<li>No workplace photos</li>
<li>Always get consent before mentioning names or sharing photos of others</li>
<li>Draft everything in private notes first, then curate what goes public</li>
<li>Be aware while writing about issues at home</li>
</ul>
<p>What to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool stuff I&rsquo;m reading, watching, or exploring</li>
<li>My latest experiments and tinkering</li>
<li>Personal projects and how they&rsquo;re coming along</li>
<li>How I&rsquo;m feeling overall</li>
<li>Interesting conversations and stories</li>
<li>Quick updates about life</li>
</ul>
<p>With Monday to Friday consumed by work, I&rsquo;ve decided to dedicate Sunday evenings to this practice. I&rsquo;m setting aside two hours to reflect on the full Monday-Sunday week, even if that means occasionally missing late weekend updates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to value these notes as an important weekly ritual—a chance document and share my journey.</p>
<h3 id="23rd-march---sunday">23rd March - Sunday</h3>
<p>I skipped going to Navjeevan Trust on Sunday. Instead, we (Nidhi, Mom, Mihir) went to watch the Gujarati film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/hi/title/tt23556594/">&lsquo;Fati ne&rsquo;</a>. It was a Horror-Comedy film, a new attempt in Gujarati films. We enjoyed it. I felt that it was a little too long&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="24th-march---monday">24th March - Monday</h3>
<p>We had our first planning meeting for Khojbeen Mandali. We discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are our learning objectives</li>
<li>What is our target age group</li>
<li>How we will document the whole thing</li>
</ul>
<p>Nidhi will take two weekly sessions at Anusandhan Learning Center.</p>
<h3 id="25th-march---tuesday">25th March - Tuesday</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We were looking for a summer intern to work on Khojbeen Mandali, but we didn&rsquo;t get good applications. Mostly freshers have applied. Also, the work is only for two months, the honorarium is low, and it&rsquo;s onsite work, not a remote job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This internship is a good opportunity for someone who is based in Ahmedabad and wants to kickstart their journey in nature education or educational research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="26th-march---wednesday">26th March - Wednesday</h3>
<p>We had a short online meeting with dear friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spidersandthesea/">Chetna</a>. We discussed Khojbeen Mandali. She shared some wonderful insights and ideas from her experience of working with children. I felt very positive and inspired after this meeting.</p>
<h3 id="27th-march---thursday">27th March - Thursday</h3>
<p>I attended an online meeting of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voicesofvishwamitri/">Voice of Vishwamitri</a> (a group of citizens working on environmental and developmental issues of Vadodara city). I wanted to attend the meetings and get involved in action but couldn&rsquo;t attend earlier because of my busy schedule. We need to make a website for the work happening around Vishwamitri river. We had a discussion around the same. I will try to make a basic prototype as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="28th-march---friday">28th March - Friday</h3>
<p>Met dear friend <a href="https://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~malay.dhamelia/">Malay</a> after a long, long time&hellip; almost after 8 years. We chatted about design thinking, aesthetics, wonder, awe, technology, work, education, life and more&hellip; He recently joined IIT G. We will try to meet frequently. This meeting was the highlight of my week.</p>

<p>We bought a mobile for Mom. She never owned a personal mobile till now (strange, right? But it is real). Instead of ordering online, we went to the nearest mobile shop and bought a Vivo model for 15k. It&rsquo;s a basic smartphone with 8GB RAM + 128GB storage. It&rsquo;s enough for Mom&rsquo;s usage. I didn&rsquo;t do research or even check the price online. I didn&rsquo;t want to go into my overthinking loop. Also, I wanted to give her the touch and feel of the buying process.</p>
<p>Nidhi wanted to do something around documenting bio diversity. We started with identifying and note down trees in our apartment compound. I am really happy that we could start this.</p>
<h3 id="30th-march---sunday">30th March - Sunday</h3>
<p>Mom went back to Padra. Nidhi and I went to drop her at Geeta Mandir bus stop.
After that, we visited Navjeevan Trust Campus. We got a surprise&hellip;
There was a farmers&rsquo; market happening there—&lsquo;Srishti Khedut Hat&rsquo;. Nidhi was super excited to see this. A few alumni of K Shala were also holding a stall there. I was super happy to meet them. We had lunch at their stall.</p>

<p>I was trying to find my old Gujarati textbook from grade 10. I wanted to read stories from it and go on a nostalgia trip, but couldn&rsquo;t find it. The textbook board has changed the textbooks. I want a textbook of grade 10 from 2010.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://amarkathao.in/rasikbhai-raso-varta-in-gujarati/">&lsquo;રસિકભૈ રસો&rsquo;</a> on the internet. I loved reading it&hellip;</p>
<p>We had an online sharing meeting with 2 of our friends who are also working in the nature-science-education field. We shared our current work and life updates&hellip; we decided that we will do this every month. I felt connected and hopeful after the meeting. Thank you Nidhi for initiating this.</p>
<h3 id="current-reading">Current Reading</h3>
<p>Almost finished &ldquo;Electric Train&rdquo; but needed a change of subject, so I started reading &ldquo;Tilor by Dhruv Bhatt&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="overall-mood">Overall mood</h3>
<p>I am so happy to see how Nidhi and Mummy are bonding.
I&rsquo;m grateful that I got the opportunity to spend time with Mummy.
I was very anxious when Mummy was leaving alone for Padra in a bus.</p>

I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus &amp;amp; local train routes.

<p>It was a roller coaster week, the end part of the week was emotionally demanding.</p>
<ul>
<li>My parents went back to Padra on Sunday. I am living in Thaltej and my parents needed to catch the bus from Geeta Mandir bus stop which is 13km away from here. I was searching for bus options, tried searching on Google and following the route but it felt complex. Too many options and variables. I wish there was one simple app where I could input the destination and it would show bus numbers, timing and routes - just like the app in Mumbai for bus &amp; local train routes. I was remembering the map man - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Planemad">Arun Ganesh</a></li>
<li>Managing wet waste, especially managing food waste is difficult in city/flat/apartment living. Doing composting when there&rsquo;s no balcony in your flat is difficult. It&rsquo;s also time consuming when both of us are working. What are some techniques I can implement? At my home in Padra we used to give food waste to dogs or cows on the street.</li>
<li>Aadhvan pointed out that my blog&rsquo;s RSS feed wasn&rsquo;t working. Images weren&rsquo;t loading in the RSS reader because the base URL was &rsquo;localhost:1313&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;learningwala.in&rsquo;. I figured that I was using the &lsquo;hugo server&rsquo; command to build the live site, which makes the base URL localhost. I changed my workflow. Now I&rsquo;m using:</li>
</ul>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo --baseURL &#34;https://learningwala.in/&#34; --cleanDestinationDir
python3 -m http.server</code></pre><p>It worked out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, I tried making markdown files from my accounts on Medium.com. I wanted to move all my old blog posts from Medium to my current Hugo site. I used Pandoc to convert HTML to markdown, downloaded all the images, added metadata, and changed image paths with the help of a Python script. Finally, I tried putting all the files in the Hugo folder. Some errors are coming up because of Medium&rsquo;s HTML elements. Now I&rsquo;m frustrated with this. I&rsquo;ll slowly just copy-paste all the posts in markdown. That will be better.</li>
<li>Went for a dinner at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cafeaarambh/?hl=en">Aarambh Cafe</a> on sunday evening. Met Bansari.We need to plan meetings with Nidhi, Bansari, Vishnu, and one more with our office team.</li>
<li>At the office, it was a hectic week, mostly meetings &amp; presentations. We celebrated &lsquo;World Storytelling Day&rsquo; on 20th March. All the teammates made impromptu stories and acted out short skits.</li>
<li>Nidhi came back from Kanpur on Thursday. We went to Kamla cafe for dinner. Dadaji is back home from the hospital and on medication.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Now for the sad part of the week. There are extreme family conflicts going on. One more big reminder for me that patriarchy is real. It is very emotionally demanding and a test of life skills. I&rsquo;m grateful that Nidhi and my close friends are with me in this difficult situation. I went to Padra on Friday, and brought mummy with me to ahemdabad. Spent Saturday with Nidhi and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-else">What else?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next month I need to visit Bhopal for a Child Development Course. Need to plan things for the same.</li>
<li>Some more short projects are coming up apart from office work. Need to respond to that.</li>
<li>Need to kick start the work of &lsquo;Khojbeen Mandali&rsquo;</li>
<li>Need to plan camp for Sakha fellows</li>
</ul>
<p>overall mood is ok, sad - angry - frustrated - hopeful - at the moment I am ok. Thanks to Nidhi &amp; mummy.</p>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Still reading Electric Train. Nidhi was telling today that she will continue her &lsquo;Banaras book&rsquo;. I might buy one or two books from Navjeevan on Sunday. I need some variety in reading, but still first preference is &lsquo;Lalit Nibandh&rsquo; - essays and second preference is short stories or poems :)</p>
<p><strong>I am looking forward to this :</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;9th-to-15-march-2025-sunday-to-saturday&#34;&gt;9th to 15 March 2025 (Sunday to Saturday)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;9th-march-sunday&#34;&gt;9th March, Sunday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I had a talk with &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/week-14-2024/&#34;&gt;Konarak&lt;/a&gt; about the problem I&amp;rsquo;m facing with my website/blog. I want to add more photos, but GitHub Pages has only a 1GB repo size limit. I was considering setting up a Raspberry Pi or an Oracle server (similar to Amazon S3). Konarak suggested trying Cloudflare Pages instead. I created a project on Cloudflare Pages and found it surprisingly simple. Initially, I was manually creating my Hugo site on my local machine and copying only the &amp;lsquo;Public&amp;rsquo; folder to CF Pages. I wondered if there was a way to deploy directly from the command line. My first attempt wasn&amp;rsquo;t successful, so I had a short call with Konarak who helped me set it up properly. Now I can deploy my site with just a single command line - much more efficient than writing multiple git commands. This website now lives on CF Pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;  &lt;figure class=&#34;img-responsive&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;picture&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_15334863afe29ca1.webp&#34; type=&#34;image/webp&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;source srcset=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_676e7a8564ccafc2.jpg&#34; type=&#34;image/jpeg&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;img&#xA;        src=&#34;https://learningwala.in/w11.2025/cfpages_hu_676e7a8564ccafc2.jpg&#34;&#xA;        alt=&#34;cf pages&#34;&#xA;        loading=&#34;lazy&#34;&#xA;        decoding=&#34;async&#34;&#xA;        width=&#34;800&#34;&#xA;      /&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/picture&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;      &lt;figcaption&gt;Github Pages v/s Cloud Flare Pages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://adhavansivaraj.xyz/&#34;&gt;Adhavan&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; weekly note and noticed he used a grid format for displaying images. I liked it and tried implementing the same thing on my blog. It took some time to figure out because I was already using shortcode for image handling and optimization. Using shortcode for both grid and image optimization together was challenging. I tried different AI tools to solve this problem - Claude, ChatGPT and Co-pilot. Co-pilot gave the simplest solution on the first attempt. ChatGPT was the worst, while Claude was average. They kept giving complex solutions that didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Watched the Gujarati film &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8982436/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Ventilator&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on a Marathi film with the same name. It was a wonderful watch. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was officially available on YouTube. Thanks to the algorithm for making my Sunday!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;10th-march-monday&#34;&gt;10th March, Monday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It was an office colleague&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so we went out for lunch with the whole team.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I had a call with Earth Educator Fellow Vimal who runs an organization called WildED. We discussed nature education, program design approaches, how to approach schools, and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I explored how to incorporate Gujarati fonts on my blog. I currently use Inconsolata fonts for English text. For Gujarati, I discovered a GitHub repository called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/samyakbhuta/chhapkaam&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Chhapkam&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, developed by my friends Samyak Bhuta and Kartik Mistry. With Co-pilot&amp;rsquo;s assistance, I figured out the process of uploading these fonts and configuring them to activate whenever I write Gujarati content in my blog posts or pages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;11th-march-tuesday&#34;&gt;11th March, Tuesday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bansari (friend/colleague from office) took me to meet her friend Vishnu, who works at American India Foundation as a science educator. We talked about life &amp;amp; education (what else can I talk about!!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;13th-march-thursday&#34;&gt;13th March, Thursday&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We played Holi at the office. I&amp;rsquo;ve never played Holi at my previous workplaces and really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h4 id="10th-march-monday">10th March, Monday</h4>
<ul>
<li>It was an office colleague&rsquo;s birthday, so we went out for lunch with the whole team.</li>
<li>I had a call with Earth Educator Fellow Vimal who runs an organization called WildED. We discussed nature education, program design approaches, how to approach schools, and more.</li>
<li>I explored how to incorporate Gujarati fonts on my blog. I currently use Inconsolata fonts for English text. For Gujarati, I discovered a GitHub repository called <a href="https://github.com/samyakbhuta/chhapkaam">&lsquo;Chhapkam&rsquo;</a>, developed by my friends Samyak Bhuta and Kartik Mistry. With Co-pilot&rsquo;s assistance, I figured out the process of uploading these fonts and configuring them to activate whenever I write Gujarati content in my blog posts or pages.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11th-march-tuesday">11th March, Tuesday</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bansari (friend/colleague from office) took me to meet her friend Vishnu, who works at American India Foundation as a science educator. We talked about life &amp; education (what else can I talk about!!)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="13th-march-thursday">13th March, Thursday</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We played Holi at the office. I&rsquo;ve never played Holi at my previous workplaces and really enjoyed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me &amp; Nidhi had a online meeting with Tanaya (from nature classroom). She is developing assessment tool to measure the impact of nature based learning intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched a film called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7790898/">Gujju Bhai - Most Wanted</a>&rsquo;. It was a fun watch. Again, thanks to my YouTube algorithm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="14th-march-friday">14th March, Friday</h4>
<ul>
<li>My parents came to Ahmedabad. Papa bought a second-hand Activa for me &amp; Nidhi. They drove from Vadodara to Ahmedabad. In the evening, we went to Palladium mall (we all wanted to spend time at the same place, and the mall was just 20 steps away from our home, so we decided to go there&hellip; it was fun discussing brands, packaging design, and fashion with papa).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="15th-march-saturday">15th March, Saturday</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Papa and I went to my office on the Activa. I wanted to check if I remembered the way. Though I wasn&rsquo;t confident, I surprisingly reached there very smoothly without looking at a map. I realized that now I have personal mobility. I&rsquo;ve never owned a vehicle before, mostly using public transport/Uber/Ola/Rapido. Most of my houses and workplaces were nearby, but now with my office 10km away and living in Ahmedabad—a happening city with drama, events, and literature-related talks—having a vehicle will be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s a heat wave going on in Ahmedabad. Luckily, I go to the office early in the morning and return after 5pm, so I skip the worst hours, but it&rsquo;s still very hot and this is just the beginning of summer. I&rsquo;m very grateful to have a living space with AC and happy that I could offer air conditioning to my parents. Environmentally, AC is the worst thing to have, but when you live in a city apartment, it&rsquo;s difficult to choose alternatives. For most years in my career, I worked in remote villages. Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m being pulled into city life&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am grateful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a new vehicle</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The opportunity to work with researchers. Currently at the office, I&rsquo;m involved in pilot activities with children where we test different hypotheses. There are proper observers/research associates documenting the whole process. I wish to move more toward the research side now. At Khojbeen (our nature-project-theater based learning initiative that Nidhi and I are nurturing), we&rsquo;re also partnering with Nature Classroom and hopefully with Srivi to research our intervention. <a href="https://www.sriviliveshere.com/">Srivi</a> is a wonderful researcher, artist, and educator. I would like to work with her on environmental aesthetics.</li>
<li>Reading a lot about aesthetic sense development lately. This might help me develop activity modules or conduct sessions. I wish to hold a session with my office team on this topic. Taking a session is the best motivation to study things in depth.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="updates-about-khojbeen-">Updates about khojbeen :</h4>
<ul>
<li>We had a meeting with Tanaya about assessment tool</li>
<li>We are in touch with srivi, we are planning to do research about aesthetic sense development in children through nature based intervention.</li>
<li>We published an invitation for summer internship positions with our team. We received a diverse range of interesting applications from PhD students all the way to 10th grade students. We&rsquo;re specifically looking for someone who is based in Ahmedabad, has a genuine interest in nature education, and is enthusiastic about working with children.</li>
</ul>

If I stay in vadodra I can go to mangal bazar or local market of padra and get the stuff. Here it was difficult to find out local market. You need to surrender to places like Dmart or blinkit.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="1st-to-8th-march-2025-saturday-to-saturday">1st to 8th March 2025 (Saturday to Saturday)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Week was super hectic, new job, new home, new city :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me and Nidhi are slowly settling down here in ahemdabad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We came here on 29th and I joined new workplace from 3rd March. so we got some time to settle the our stuff, figure out breakfast, lunch places,vegetable - fruit vendors, bought some grocery - kitchen utensils. living in big city is difficult. If I stay in vadodra I can go to mangal bazar or local market of padra and get the stuff. Here it was difficult to find out local market. You need to surrender to places like Dmart or blinkit. I am very very grateful to Nidhi, she did all the setup for kitchen, rooms.. made the place homelike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>during Saturday and Sunday :</p>
<ul>
<li>I watched amazing documentary called &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiL4ply2f44">Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai</a>&rsquo; based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Kumar_Shukla">Vinod Kumar Shukla</a>&rsquo;s life &amp; work.</li>
<li>Went to Navjeevan Trust Campus after long time. Explored their new book store called &lsquo;Hridaykunj&rsquo;. Got 2 new books. Banaras Dairy by Vivek Desai (English translation), Electric Train (Gujarati) by Geeta Nayak. Both the books were in my list to buy from long time. I bought banaras dairy in english so Nidhi can also read. She is from UP but never get chance to visit banaras, now a days she is making efforts to know and connect with her city - state. I was keen to read banaras dairy in gujarati, I was in doubt if I will understand and feel the content in english or not. Nidhi did loud reading of one of chapters. It was good&hellip; I can visualize.. accept when some unknown words come in..</li>
<li>We also had dinner at &lsquo;Karma Cafe&rsquo; at Navjeevan Trust Campus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work is going well. We have young energetic - learning oriented team. I will need some more time to figure out transport. My office is 12km away from home. Right now I using repido bike service. Everyday I am meeting new new characters of repido bike drivers. I will write about it in detail on some other day. For coming back I take lift from team members.. papa bought second hand activa for us, it is in vadodra right now. We need to figure out how to bring that here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got tagged by <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">Thej</a> to answer some questions about blogging - <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/a-challenge-of-blog-questions/">Why blog?</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Published some material on <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/aesthetics-sense-develoment-/">aesthetics sense development</a> &amp; <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/panchkosh/">Panchkosh / IKS</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on saturday 8th march me &amp; nidhi completed one month of our marriage. Nidhi&rsquo;s mom reminded us :) most of the time we forget that we are &ldquo;married&rdquo;. Nidhi order noodles and choco lava to celebrate the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;22nd-to-28th-feb-2025-saturday-to-friday&#34;&gt;22nd to 28th Feb 2025 (Saturday to Friday)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week was super busy. Most days, we were out. We are newlyweds, so family and friends are inviting us for lunch and dinner at their place. We enjoy going to friends&amp;rsquo; places, but at relatives&amp;rsquo; places, Nidhi needs to be ready in a saree or kurta with ornaments and all. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it, so it was tough for her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On 22nd Feb: we went to Mitali ben&amp;rsquo;s place. We enjoyed chatting with Mitali Ben&amp;rsquo;s mom and Jagat Bhai. It&amp;rsquo;s a family.. every minute cracking jokes happens.. very light environment, cricket, movies, puns, and more.

<p>This week was super busy. Most days, we were out. We are newlyweds, so family and friends are inviting us for lunch and dinner at their place. We enjoy going to friends&rsquo; places, but at relatives&rsquo; places, Nidhi needs to be ready in a saree or kurta with ornaments and all. She doesn&rsquo;t like it, so it was tough for her.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 22nd Feb: we went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s place. We enjoyed chatting with Mitali Ben&rsquo;s mom and Jagat Bhai. It&rsquo;s a family.. every minute cracking jokes happens.. very light environment, cricket, movies, puns, and more. I wish my family become like this. It gives you mental peace that everything is ok, we will handle it. At my place, it was like war was happening, strict, silent, needful talk only..anyway..</li>

<p>On 25th Feb: we went to Anushree&rsquo;s place to have lunch. Anushree is a new friend from Vadodra. She contacted me for her research on karma &amp; shradha. Me &amp; Nidhi both participated in the research.. and became good friends.</p>
<p>She is from a Marathi family living in Vadodara. We enjoyed talking to her ajji and visiting her small garden in the compound. She is an upcycling expert, she made many interesting things for trash.</p>

<p>On 26th Feb: on Shivaratri, Nidhi and mummy-papa visited our community temple in the Narmada district called Nandikeshwar Mahadev. The roads were very bad and it was 3hrs journey. Everyone was tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we visited my mama&rsquo;s place for dinner (we visited 3 relative&rsquo;s places in one day.. it was overwhelming)</p>

<ul>
<li>In between all these we did packing for our next move. One day mummy also came and helped us. It was very very helpful. It could take a longer time for me and Nidhi if she didn&rsquo;t come.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>28th Feb: I &amp; Nidhi finally moved to Ahmedabad on Friday. Ravi Bhai offered us his flat to use for some time. So we can find a proper place to live. Finding a house in a big cities is a tough job. We both are very greatful to him.
Nidhi doesn&rsquo;t like flats/apartments, she likes old-style houses with open spaces, gardens, and all. I also like those but it&rsquo;s a luxury in the city.</p>
<p>Now a new journey is starting, finding a home, finding a workplace for Nidhi, finding healthy food options (we both have stomach issues) finding a cook, setting up stuff in a home, and transport options.. should we buy a scooter or not.. many actions are in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After reaching Ahmedabad. First setup after reaching to Ahmedabad  :</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="25th-to-31st-jan-2025-saturday-to-friday">25th to 31st Jan 2025 (Saturday to Friday)</h4>
<p><strong>Saturday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zby_Sav6Y4">How Vinay Malge became the catalyst for Bidar&rsquo;s heritage revival | DH Changemakers 2025</a></li>
<li>tried osm mapping</li>
<li>did washing machine repairing at home with papa and mummy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>

<li>wrote summary about session published <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/biology-of-money/">blog post</a> and my prep note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>watched arun ganesh&rsquo;s interview</li>
<li>spent time to study adhavana&rsquo;s work</li>
<li>I tried OSM Go app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had short call with Thejesh GN about how to do survey of biodiversity / tree mapping.
he shared tool called kobo tool box (<a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">https://www.kobotoolbox.org/</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vidit came from the canada for few months. He is super confused and stressed about going back to canada.He is analyzing that should he stay in india and do the job or should he go back to canda and do hardwork to save money and come back.. it&rsquo;s classic immigration conundrum. We had long discussion, we went to vadodra, had lunch at nice gujarati thali restaurant called Kathivadi Darbar - Alkapuri. After that we went to buy Monitor screen for me. It was a long pending task to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we bought refurbished Dell E2421HN 24inch monitor in 5k and logitech wireless mouse and keyboard (K275) . I was very confusing during the shopping, I was comparing online price, which brand and technology to buy and everything&hellip; finally i took a plunge. it&rsquo;s nice quality not very slim and attractive like what I see online but it is decent. I am trying this new keyboard. It&rsquo;s a mechanical keyboard. After using thinkpad&rsquo;d keyboard it is difficult to shift to any other keyboard. let&rsquo;s see how it goes. I think I will like it in sometime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spent time in researching about the monitor. It is my habit. Which now I don&rsquo;t like.
I keep researching and justifying my decision. In this case I keep justifying my step to not buying IPS monitor because it was costly (8k) and I don&rsquo;t need it because I am not doing gaming or graphic designing work. But when ever I read that IPS gives good color accuracy and it is good for eyes. At that time my mind goes mad and it tells me to go back to shop and give back the monitor and buy another one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This confusion is very interesting. I am experimenting with it for low stack environment so I can learn and apply it in other situation also. I read about e - ink screens which seems best for the low eye strain and also for distraction free work.
People are making <a href="https://www.modos.tech/">e- ink monitors</a> and <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/">tabs</a>. Some people are trying gray scale on their existing monitors and phones. I also tried gray scale on my ubuntu device. It took some time to find out right tool to do system wide gray scale. Thanks to chat GPT. It was fun experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this whole thing is about how brain works. How we are taking a decisions. What we prioritize and why. I was remembering Paras Chopra&rsquo;s mental models. Also thinking about cognitive basis. finally I had chat with chat GPT which gave me some peace :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abhijit was in Vadodra to take session at oasis. I went to vadodara to meet him. We had a lunch at kathiwadi darbar. This is second time I am going to kathiwadi darbar in same week. After lunch we went to visit Aditya&rsquo;s maker space &lsquo;Forrest of us&rsquo;. They are doing very nice work. I am happily jalousie. At that day they were working on wast management of Vadodra marathon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also return the monitor I have bought. I had talk with suchakra and he suggested to buy new <a href="https://www.amazon.in/LG-IPS-sRGB-Height-Adjust-Display/dp/B0BRQT57RC/ref=mp_s_a_1_10?crid=1H4NH4KLPIHXP&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._T_qxcACiBpvKYmQSvgLsW4s0T3usIbvmqF8SRaqTAZgmWnAot7QBFC4w_L_7Yk126yZcmZo6wC6F2N4IFh4xu99ugCCcUuPqgybu-fdOhIPmTlBT3wDNqCPncem5er2gaNCjJlSokyZNYZY3G494MUKaWlimUjKyarCJZYXNvLuPohREB4SqZtimtiIB8pG5HbomJmwj40-e08oBVqQ6A.3w1owtm-qWWQ-HYXuIYhe21SIgrTQyiXSvKTTYbZyuc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=benq+qhd+monitor+24+inches&amp;nsdOptOutParam=true&amp;qid=1738175044&amp;sprefix=benq+qhd+monitor%2Caps%2C459&amp;sr=8-10">LG QHD monitor</a> which is good for reading, writing, coding. So I ordered at same shop in Vadodra. Suchakra also sponsored part of the total amount of the monitor as a marriage gift :) Very thoughtful gift&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got msg Radhika from Balgokulam. They are ready to hire my as learning facilitator. I was waiting for this confirmation since last 2 months. Finally it came. Now we need to finalize where should we go ? Kanisa or ahemdabd ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in last weekly note I have written that we will not go for jashdan and join kanisa but now game is changed.</p>
<p>→ Stability &amp; social life : ahemdabad is ok ok city. We can come to vadodara in two hours.
→ Finance : salary + grant<br>
→ Stimulation at work / meaningful work : it&rsquo;s seems interesting. Nature education for kindergarten children + I can continue sakha fellowship and local khoji work in vadodra. I can learn research part. It will be corporate style setting but I need to be flexible.
→ Nidhi&rsquo;s work / working together :  she can come to balgokulam, she can join anusandhan ngo , we can find new places</p>
<p>we had a long call with Mitali ben. She also suggested to go ahemdabd.
Now I need to think about winding up DEFY work in march and find out home and everything in ahemdabd. Still I am confuse, unsure, let&rsquo;s see.. universe will take care.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had a call with Ravi bhai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mostly spent time for office meetings/work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>overall good week,</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Me and Nidhi are thinking about giving proper name and visual identity to our nature education work. Learningwala is there but nidhi is feeling that, it is my brand and my work, she is not feeling that she is part of it. So we have decided to create something new which we both can hold and nurture.</p>
<p>I was thinking about different names.. KhojBeen Mandali suck to my mind. Nidhi also liked it. I started reaching out to people seeking help in visual identity. Rachita called me and gave some ideas about how to start. I had a chat with Ipsa Jain, Ashra, Nipun Prabhakar, Jinal, Chaitali and few other folks about the same.</p>

<p><strong>Overall mood and other things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall I am happy. Work at DEFY is going well.</li>
<li>I am happy that my and nidhi&rsquo;s friends are coming to our wedding</li>
<li>After eliminating all the options we have decided to go to <a href="https://www.ntpatelhighschool.org/">Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</a> from march. <a href="https://gopaldham.org/">Gopaldham</a> option is still open, today morning I had call with Varun. He is ready to accommodate both of us with salary we are expecting. The only thing is it is very remote area and we will feel alone. Here mitali ben is there, vadodra is near by so it will work out. I told varun that we will meet after 15th feb. We will visit the school so we can get idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly we will take a risk and go to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :)</p>
<p><strong>Process of elimination :</strong></p>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;28th-dec-2024-to-4th-jan-2025-saturday-to-saturday&#34;&gt;28th Dec 2024 to 4th Jan 2025 (Saturday to Saturday)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;During Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 me and Nidhi did worked with different groups of children, facilitated worskhops, orgnized residential camps and more. I tried to capture all our activities in one photo report - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.canva.com/design/DAGaq8utmtg/O439oGkID5vYzoAcNmCFkQ/view?utm_content=DAGaq8utmtg&amp;amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;amp;utm_source=uniquelinks&amp;amp;utlId=h2c229f4669#1&#34;&gt;Gulmohar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/2024-reflections/&#34;&gt;2024 year end reflections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wanted to work with young people for so long. I wanted to design fellowship kind of program where they get opportunity to work on real life projects, travel, meet people outside of their circle. Finally it worked out. Friends from sai&amp;rsquo;s angel foundation + Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are working on something called sakha fellowship. We are launching it on 12th Jan.

<ul>
<li>During Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 me and Nidhi did worked with different groups of children, facilitated worskhops, orgnized residential camps and more. I tried to capture all our activities in one photo report - <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGaq8utmtg/O439oGkID5vYzoAcNmCFkQ/view?utm_content=DAGaq8utmtg&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;utm_source=uniquelinks&amp;utlId=h2c229f4669#1">Gulmohar</a></li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://learningwala.in/blog/2024-reflections/">2024 year end reflections</a></li>
<li>I wanted to work with young people for so long. I wanted to design fellowship kind of program where they get opportunity to work on real life projects, travel, meet people outside of their circle. Finally it worked out. Friends from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation + Me &amp; Nidhi are working on something called sakha fellowship. We are launching it on 12th Jan. I spent time on developing all the ideas related to it.</li>
<li>My health went down, fever, low blood pressure</li>
<li>I am getting married on 4th Feb. Preparations are going in full swing. On 5th Jan relatives are going to come at home to write invitation card (Kankotri in Gujarati) so I helped parents to prepare for the same.</li>
<li>I did calculation of all funding and other money I have and how much I utilize in what.
Didn&rsquo;t get proper calculation for salary money (money apart from grant).</li>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult for me to sit and write reflection of year 2024 because biggest milestone of my life - &amp;lsquo;Marriage&amp;rsquo; is in Feb 2025. Prep for that is going on. Me &amp;amp; Nidhi are also figuring out where to stay after marriage and where to work. Because of my family situation we need to stay near to my hometown Padra - Vadodara. So technically my year is still running.. but still I will try to put what ever is coming in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>In Feb 2024 we did <a href="https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/LZQcbKVxaVXu1iZ9SvLeau2F">&lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo;</a> exhibition. It was a culmination of 3 -4 month long journey with Imapana (student from BeMe school). I am very grateful to BeMe for giving me this space to experiment like this. It was long time wish to do this type of work with children. I am planning to write article on pedagogical aspect of this experiment.</p>

<p>In Feb I have visited Chennai beach to see turtle nesting with Harshit (student from BeMe). <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">It was very new experience for me</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I met many inspiring &amp; intersting people this year - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C21GbryIQ97/?img_index=1">Jane Sahi</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C30Qx76tfhv/?img_index=1">Arun V</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C51RvfvoGYh/?img_index=1">Anand Chitipothu</a>, <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/">Paras Chopra</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wowsig/?hl=en">Aakansha Gaur</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C59-MIZIeKj/">Nature Classroom team</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C14ocvOIbaO/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">ATREE Water workshop</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C2gbwwFItFS/?img_index=1">Sci Gallary BLR taeam</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C6Dvv9yoMh1/">Anish &amp; Junuka</a></p>

<h3 id="moving-back-to-vadodara">Moving back to Vadodara</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Left bangalore and moved to Vadodra : I shifted to BLR on Dec 2022 to join BeMe and spend more time with Nidhi (She was studying in Azim Premji University that time). After finishing MA in education at APU, Nidhi took job at org called ThinkTac - Science education company. She didn&rsquo;t liked the nature of work. It was more working in content development side rather than facilitation / working with children or teacher. She was more interested in facilitation that time. She left the job in 4 months (Jun 2023 - Sep 2023). She took break of 7 months (Oct 2023 - Apr 2024 ) during the break she did small projects like helping me in setting up the time exhibition, book translation for nature classroom, etc.</p>
<p>After one point we both felt that we need to move somewhere else to work. Because joing BeMe was not the option for her that time. If she gets the job somewhere in BLR, everything is very far and expensive. I never wanted to leave BeMe. It was my dream job. But nothing was working out.</p>
<p>We tried shifting to Pune. I got the job at Anubhuti learning center. Similar alternative space like beme. But Nidhi was not getting appropriate job. So we canceled the option.</p>
<p>During that time parents were encouraging me to come back to vadodra, they were feeling lonely, their health were not ok, we wanted to be around them so we can take our marriage conversation forward. So we decided that let&rsquo;s go back to vadodara.</p>
<p>Some how it worked out. I had a talk with Ravi bhai and he offered 1 year grant. I got job as content developer at Pratham Foundation.
Aaakansha also offered 1 year - Escape Velosity Grant to us. So with all of support, we came to Vadodra on 30th April 2024.</p>
<p>Nidhi also got <a href="https://bhoomicollege.org/teach-for-nature-fellowship-fellows">&lsquo;Teach for Nature Fellowship&rsquo;</a> to work in Nature Education in Vadodara.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="engagement---mihir--nidhi">Engagement - Mihir &amp; Nidhi</h3>
<ul>
<li>First thing we did after moving back was event of our formal engagement with friends and family members. It was tough.
10 people coming from Kanpur in train staying in small town like padra, managing whole event, managing everyone&rsquo;s ego - emotions - expectations.. it was tough for me and nidhi both. But we did it. We came out of our comfort zone and did it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happiest moment was when our friends came to the event and stood with us.</p>

<li>Nidhi rented out flat and started working with Rameshwari ben and Amit bhai.</li>

<h3 id="work-at-pratham">Work at Pratham</h3>
<p>Pratham was roller coaster experience. In the beginning I was very happy that I got remote job so I can stay in vadodra and also do other work. Secondly it was content development job in environment domain. My team was producing videos for topics like climate change, plastic literacy and more. There was interesting project called creativity club in our account too. Where we need to develop prompt videos for children age 10+ yrs to foster their creativity, collaboration, communication and problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Overall work was interesting but I could sustain there for more than 7 months.</p>
<p>Few reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It was remote team with large scale, deadline driven project. Working in high peace environment with remote team was new experience for me. I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to team and the factory approach which we were using for content development. I felt very disconnected from ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my skills were not very good for this type of work environment. I mostly worked with children or teachers. On ground. Never worked with canva - excel - chatgpt. So it was good learning.</p>
<p>I first time wrote script for videos
I first time made posters &amp; videos on canva
I was part of team of the project at this scale for first time where my content goes to thousands of children pan India.</p>
<p>I learnt how to make content for creativity and other 21st century skills. Mainly we were using design thinking activities, replicating already available activities in our format. But making it useful for large scale project is also good learning.</p>
<p>I learnt about how large scale orgs works, I learnt little bit about partnerships and funding</p>
<p>best part of my work was coordinating with nature educators from all over India to nature education camps with children at different location. It was good that I already had network of people in the domain.</p>
<p>I left pratham on 15th Nov 2024. Took few days back break and joined <a href="https://projectdefy.org/">Project DEFY</a> (25th Nov 2024) as subject matter expert - self directed learning. It&rsquo;s 3 months remote assignment.</p>
<p>during pratham days I first time experienced serious anxiety. Stress. Somehow it was very chill for other team members. But I was not handle constant stress, constant communication &amp; coordination.. it was very bad phase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-work--expectations-from-home">Finding Work &amp; expectations from home</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aakansha and Ravi bhai offered the grant for the one year. I left the pratham so now we didn&rsquo;t have any backup for money.
most of the pratham&rsquo;s salary is going to be used in marriage event (all the shopping, jewellery and all). Nidhi has some money coming through fellowship but that also she was not able to continue because multiple things going on at home. so we reached out to all social media, all the friends with the <a href="https://learningwala.in/ourneeds/">request</a>. we got many calls from alternative schools from south, many orgs, individuals.</p>
<p>we are very very grateful to all the people who reached out to us with offerings. People who connected us with other people, people who thought about us.</p>
<p>Because of my family situation we need to stay near to vadodra / ahemdabad. My parents wants us to stay near to them. Because of their loneliness, because of their health, because their insecurities , because they feel socially confident when we are around.. for whatever reasons they are not happy about we leaving vadodra and go far from them.</p>
<p>one more aspect to it is they want Nidhi to be house wife kind of person. Helping my mother to do all the work, not taking independent work. My home is based in Patriarchy system. so to stay far from it we need to find work-stay option where we are not very near to them and not very far.</p>
<p>This year very big chunk of my time went to fight and manage the balance of our values and expectations from family. Friends helped me a lot in this. thank you rameshwari ben, mitali ben, many other friends.</p>
<p>Now we are stuck, we have very limited option at vadodra / ahemdabad for meaningful and well paid work. After eliminating many options right now we left with very few :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mitali ben&rsquo;s school :</strong> Ravi bhai is willing to continue grant next year also, Aakansha also offered that if I can help her in some admin work of &rsquo;escape velocity grant&rsquo; she can offer grant for one more year. With this assurance we can move to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school 2hrs far from vadodra and work there. Next year we can again search for grant. (Inlaks Grants, The Circle incubation) Also we can find out some part time / remote work if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> we can work directly with children, we can develop nature education curriculum / do action reasecrh. Nidhi and me can work on our health, we can also be near to my family. We can also work with other orgs in Vadodra because it is just 2hrs away.</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> Instability of funding, we might feel lonely sometime in village.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Gopaldham learning center :</strong> it is an Ashramshala in Jashdan near rajkot / chotila. 5hrs from vadodra. they are looking for school leader kind of person.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> there are only 70 children, we will get full freedom to do meaningful work. We both will get work. Good payment also</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> this is new place. We don&rsquo;t know the founders and team personally. No friends, we will feel lonely. We need to leave work we have started in vadodra</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Balgokulam :</strong> it is an early childhood research org based in ahemdabad.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro :</strong> good salary. My role will direct working with children and researching about early childhood curriculum. so new learning opportunity. we can come to vadodara when ever is needed, it is just 2hrs</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> new set up don&rsquo;t know what exactly my role looks like. It is new org started in 2023 so don&rsquo;t know the future. We will need to find job for nidhi.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Eklavya, Bhopal :</strong> with Aakansha&rsquo;s funding we can go eklavya bhopal and start working there with libraries. I am not sure that ravi bhai will give funding for that.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pros :</strong> Eklavya family will be there, lots of new people, friends, projects</p>
<p><strong>Cons :</strong> instability of funding. We need to leave our work which we started in vadodra. We might not get access to children like school. Because we will work with libraries.</p>
<p>I am eliminating BLR right now but we have shortlisted some org if we want to go : creative school, beme, project DEFY, seed to sapling, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Me &amp; Nidhi both went to Nephropathy this year at Nisargupchar Kendra - Gotri, Vadodra. It is wonderful place.
I am suffering from stomach problems and Nidhi is suffering from skin - hair issues. (apart from our mental health) We tried following the diet for month or two.. it was magical.. it works. eating millets and doing yoga. After one point of time it got difficult for us to manage the routine and making food at home. but we want to start it again when we get new place to stay and work. This year I want to start doing regular exercise &amp; eating healthy food. (This very basic and obvious thing but very hard to do )</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="golu">Golu</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nidhi&rsquo;s brother Tanishk aka golu was also there with us in Vadodra for few months. Nidhi invited him to take break after his 12th exam and explore options other than joining privet engineering collage. It was mistake&hellip; we were not ready. it was difficult to make some one self directed learner in short time. Also against his will. It was good learning for us to see what is happening inside us when situation like this come on our face. what happens inside us? , can we empathize ? it was tough time for me personally.</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t find meaning in this type of exploration time, he became phone - game addict, he bought new iphone and it was game changer for him&hellip; in short some mistake from our side, some expectation from his side.. it didn&rsquo;t work out. I was so happy when he went back home. I was genuinely concerned and still I am concerned about his future. I never thought bad about him but our expectation didn&rsquo;t match. We were super busy in our work we really didn&rsquo;t give proper time to him&hellip; it was wrong timing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our work got recognized : <a href="https://www.early-bird.in/meet-an-educator-mihir-pathak/">ebird - meet the educator article</a> - feeling proud.</li>
<li>I could manage to do local khoji event even with the stress and work load of pratham. I could have done better if I have time. I really didn&rsquo;t get time for the facilitating the project.</li>
<li>We (Nidhi, Mihir, Impana) managed to do &lsquo;A matter of time&rsquo; exhibition. I was on cloud 7 :)</li>
<li>This year I wrote regular <a href="https://learningwala.in/tags/weekly-notes/">weekly notes</a> on my website from week 12 to week 52 = 40 weeks = 10 months. I never thought that I will continue this habit. But I did. I am proud of it.</li>
<li>In first week of Dec I visited BLR to attend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDd2w5movCJ/?img_index=1">wipro partners</a> (my reflections) forum and meeting children at BeMe. Meeting children from 12+ group was a joy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2024/beme.jpeg" alt="BeMe Children "></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This year was very stressful and I felt serious anxiety many a times. Because of nature of work at Pratha,Home / family issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I first time tried fund raising. I pitched our work and managed to raised 9L rupees for a year from individual donors. I am very very grateful to them for trusting us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did session with corporate team for first time. Thank you Mitali ben for co- facilitating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year I contributed / spent big amount of grant money and pratham&rsquo;s salary money for marriage prep, which I didn&rsquo;t like. I wanted to use that money for children or save it for future. Any way I am happy that we did camp from that money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year also I am part of Child Development and learning course at Eklavya. I co facilitated sessions this time. After the physical workshop we as team to need to be more active to respond the participant&rsquo;s need. But I felt that other team members are busy with other work and not able to give priority to this. It is frustrating for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year we (Nidhi and Mihir) took many workshops and sessions with different age groups. In 2025 we want to take up one project and do deeper work in that. We will take up the project of developing curriculum for Nature Detective program (age 3 to 11yrs) and for older age group we will work with children from sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We will also plan to do action research kind of thing with Nature Classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took logistic responsibility for the residential camps we did this year. I invited Nidhi, Nishtha and Prerna for facilitation. It was a good experience for me. I learnt about my self that I enjoy doing this type of work also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of sangha - tribe - community got stronger in mind this year. I learnt that if you want to walk on this path of alternatives you need strong sangha.. and you need to selflessly contribute in that sangha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year tested my and nidhi&rsquo;s bonding.. hard time.. stress.. things we hated came back to us&hellip;but we are strong &amp; together. Thank you so much Nidhi for being you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these years I was very confused about my offering in education. I am not a subject teacher, I am not a teacher trainer, I don&rsquo;t want to start NGO to scale things.. what exactly I want to do ? This year I got some answers :</p>

<h3 id="what-next-">What next ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work front : till 15th March 2025 - Project DEFY&rsquo;s work is there.</li>
<li>Need to figure out work after that. Gopaldham and Balgokulam people will reply in mid Jan. After that we will take a call. I am mostly inclined towards going to mitali ben&rsquo;s school for 1 year and then going back to BLR / stay back if we get regular funding. If we go to mitali ben&rsquo;s school, we will take up curriculum development project for nature detective and also collaborate with nature classroom for action research &amp; material development.</li>
<li>I want to continue work in vadodara. Specially with sai&rsquo;s angel foundation. We (Rameshwari ben , Ashish bhai, Saurabh bhai, Nikita ben, Suraj, Mihir &amp; Nidhi) started one fellowship program for teenager. It&rsquo;s kind of swaraj university model / beme model / self directed learning / relationship model. It was a longest wish to do this type of work with youth. I am looking forward to that.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am prying to universe to give me strength to manage my wedding event peacefully</p>
<p>After writing this much I still feel I missed something..but it&rsquo;s ok. I will update here if I remember something.
let&rsquo;s hope for the best. At this moment I just want to say thank you to Nidhi for always being with me in every situation. Thank you so much to all my friends and extended family.</p>

<p>1st Dec : we (Mihir, Nidhi and Mitali ben) met jagdish bhai (donor of kanisa school)
2nd Dec : spent time with Nidhi at her place. We went for a brunch at Cafe Bangalore. We mostly talked about the Job and future of our work.</p>
<p>at this point we have few opportunities :</p>
<p>We have eliminated these :</p>
<ul>
<li>creative school and other alternative schools in BLR</li>
<li>Moving to Cooore / Joining youcan</li>
</ul>
<p>Current options :</p>
<ul>
<li>Project DEFY and BeMe (Bangalore)</li>
<li>Balgokulam</li>
<li>Vapi home schooling group</li>
<li>getting funds and work at Mitali ben&rsquo;s place</li>
<li>going to bhopal, find out some work at Eklavya</li>
<li>Shishukunj, Bhuj</li>
<li>varun khimani jashdan - gopaldham learning center</li>
</ul>
<p>right now we both are feeling that Bangalore option is great financially and growth wise
but my family (specifically father) wants that we stay in Vadodra and do work here. We are feeling helpless.
we want to be near to our parents but other side there is a financial struggle, we will not get money in Vadodara.
we can definitely do good work if we get funding. let&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>4th to 7th dec - APU - Wipro Partners Forum 2024</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>meeting went well.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>sunday morning me and Nidhi came to padra, satyed till evening. Evening we (Mihir, Nidhi, Golu) went to SAF (sai&rsquo;s angel foundation)
one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; I have praposed two ideas</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture</li>
<li>tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do</li>
</ol>
<p>most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children&rsquo;s enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.</p>
<p>I shifited back to padra.</p>
<p><strong>Monday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nidhi went to Mitali ben&rsquo;s school</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tuesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work. In evening I met <a href="https://ccl.iitgn.ac.in/team/nihar-pandya">Nihar Pandya</a> at Gulmahor</li>
<li>My blood presure got down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wednesday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to hospital</li>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thursday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>office work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Friday :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>went to nidhi&rsquo;d place and worked form there.</li>
<li>it was difficult day for me. First of telling at home that I want to go at Nidhi&rsquo;s place. I was anxious. At nidhi&rsquo;s place it was difficult for me to listen golu&rsquo;s voice. I don&rsquo;t like the rude tone and other thing is whole routine stuff.. I can&rsquo;t see him like this. I shouldn&rsquo;t give this option of gap year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what else ?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I randomly did msg to Yogen shah, wrong decision. His is just like I met him for so 10 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratham work is going good. Now I am confident about writing script, making poster and editing / making video in canva.
For canva part I still take help of Archi and Neha. They are pro. I need to play more with canva to make it normal for me. Just like I tinker with my website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sunday khoji club will not happen. I need to go for prayer of one relative. But children are very very excited. They ready with their tasks.
I see big hope to this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early bird approached for facilitating birdwalk in Vadodara. I am not sure we will able to do it or not. I will take final call today and email them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am learning to balance my time between work, Nidhi&rsquo;s place and parents place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Thursday I saw documentary on swami brahmvedantaji again. This is like 5th or 6th time. This I understood what is &lsquo;self - remembering&rsquo; and what is the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો હોંશ થી કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં તમારી હાજરી રહે એવી રીતે કરો</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>જે પણ કરો એમાં પણ રહેવાનું છે અને સાથે સાથે આપણું મૂળ સ્વરૂપ પણ યાદ રાખવાનું છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there is real self without any filters. our ego is making this suffering more difficult.
we need to remember our true self each movement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too much gyan. It is simple practice.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="31st-august-to-7th-sep-2024">31st August to 7th Sep 2024</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>last saturday was working</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday nidhi went to take a session at vinoba ashram with amit bhai. This time I stayed home. Took some rest.
If I go to a workshop it takes half of my Sunday and it&rsquo;s difficult to get a break on weekdays because of work.
It was difficult for me to decide because Nidhi needs support in session. But we had a chat and she agreed to go alone.
My evening session at sai&rsquo;s angel foundation got canceled because their office got flooded during heavy rains last to last week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monday, Tuesday - hectic days at work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wednesday we went to Nisarag Upchar Kendra (Vinoba Ashram) to take naturopathy treatment for me and nidhi. It was a long due.
We got a new routine and diet. We need to eat Millets, fruits, soups :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thursday, Friday - again busy days at work. Following a new routine is fun + a little difficult. Especially since there are three people at home.
all three need to eat different things. Golu don&rsquo;t like millets and things we eat without masala. So we need to cook for everyone differently.
Nidhi and my diet has some common elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nidhi is trying to manage new routine and her work (taking sessions with children and planning for the sessions). Right now most of her time is going in to cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the rains washing machine got damaged. Repair guy came yesterday and fixed it. It was a panel issue. I didn&rsquo;t give much attention..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the parents front : Mitali ben had a talk with my parents and now we need to go to meet them on sunday. I am super anxious about what I will talk about&hellip;
According to mitali ben they are ready for marriage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They just want</p>
<ul>
<li>ki me Nidhi ko financial support na karu apne pese bacha ke rakhu :) basically financial security</li>
<li>Nidhi jab bhi mere familiy valo se mile thoda friendly tarike se mile</li>
<li>they are ok ki hum bahar rahe..</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>This Sunday I have my &lsquo;khoji club&rsquo; session planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else ?</p>
<p>I am super frustrated with golu’s behavior. Talking in loud voice
Talking rudely with nidhi, seeing everything from lens of money.
Where I will get more money
Which thing is more costly, I want to grab that because it is costly = good / status
Not getting uncomfortable in anything</p>
<p>He is not following routine at all, all day watching reels or tarak mehta.. All day putting earphones in ears. Waking up like 10 - 11 everyday…</p>
<p>Actually I am ok with routine because, eventually he will get bored and find some activity to learn.
We gave some options like gym, swimming, coaching class for CUET exam, Ankur warikoo’s online course about communication, self learning math and other subjects</p>
<p>He is doing that online course sometimes, and sometimes he does self learning for math. other options are on hold because of rain and willingness
But it is like 2 hrs a day.. All the other time goes on mobile..</p>
<p>I am doubtful that mobile phones will not give the opportunity to get bored.
Let’s see…</p>
<p>Now I am feeling that we should have not called him here and let him do the college he was planning to do. Now it is too late</p>
<p>Few days ago my anger bursted and said something to golu which he didn’t like.
Today I will try to write a sorry email to him.</p>

It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="17th-to-24th-august-2024">17th to 24th August 2024</h4>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Sunday Nidhi and I took a workshop at Vinoba Ashram on biodiversity. It was in collaboration with Amit bhai (paper ball education and Vinoba ashram). I was stressed because of home stuff and not sure if I can facilitate it or not. I was thinking about not going to the workshop but nidhi was very keen that you need to come. But I sent a msg to Amit bhai saying that I will not co facilitate, I am not in a good state of mind.In the morning we went, and when I saw children I couldn’t resist to go on the floor 🙂</p>
<p>Also I wanted to support Nidhi. It went well. It was not a very well planned session but it was the first session and everything was new for Nidhi so she did planning according to her understanding. I gave very less time to planning. Next time we will do more tight planning.</p>
<p>I can see Nidhi growing as a facilitator. She is opening up slowly. She needs to learn how to judge the group and decide the activities.</p>
<p>Working with Amit bhai is a little bit difficult because of his expectations and ideas about the activities. But his intention is good so we will figure it out. We will figure out a way to work together.</p>
<p>Now the next workshop is on 2nd september so we need to work on the same. Topic is - ecosystem and interconnectedness</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Monday we were at home only, did home set up the kitchen and other stuff.</p>
<p>Tuesday we went to the office, Nidhi had a meeting with Amit bhai. Reflected on the session.</p>
<p>I did my pratham’s work. Evening we went to a restaurant. Amit bhai shared that Gulmahor will be not available for september so we have decided to work from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Wed, Thu, Fri and Sat - not been to the office. Worked from home only.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Work wise it was a good productive week. I completed most of my tasks.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Whole week I woke around 7.30 to 7.40 (except today. Today I woke up at 8.13) and did stretching, reading for some time. Nidhi also woke up around 8 whole week. She also did stretching. I felt so happy that she did it without being negative. Today we did suryanamaskar together. It was fun.</p>
<p>Nidhi made breakfast - lunch and dinner everyday. It was very good for my stomach and eating together was fun.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; We got Jio wifi on thursday. Now I can attend office calls without any limits and yes we can watch tv without any worry about data limit. It is useful and tempting both. We saw lage raho munna bhai and all india rank together (Golu, Nidhi, Mihir)</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; Working with golu is tough for me. Waking up late, being sleepy and not active in the morning, watching TV or mobile all the time, connecting everything with money - fame - success, not focusing on tasks, being negative in doing physical activity. Eating chilen, not sleeping without AC. I took all the things on my ego. I got stressed about how we will go forward with this mindset.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a good discussion about the future plan. How to do projects and prepare for the exam. We saw all the courses on the internet but he is not sure what to do. So we decided to do projects and prepare for the common university entrance exam.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see how everything goes. I am hopeful. I also want to learn how to work with teenagers of this background.</p>
<p>I saw that entrepreneurship is a common subject we like so we will do something about it. Today I gave him a challenge to sit without doing anything for two hours. Let&rsquo;s see he can do it. I will give 1k if I can. I know I should not introduce money in this but I can&rsquo;t help but think that other options are closed right now.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; What else ? Other things are ok. Whenever I think about situations at home, I feel stressed so I am engaging myself in other tasks. Not thinking about it. I am looking forward to the session at sai’s angle - saturday club. Yesterday Neha from Moinee foundation called me for curriculum development work, I am looking forward to that also.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 id="3rd-to-10th-august-2024">3rd to 10th August 2024</h4>
<ul>
<li>Came to gulmahor evryday with Nidhi</li>
<li>We (Mihir &amp; Nidhi) met harshal from wipro eartian on 7th august. It was wonderful meeting. We got to know that he runs interesting children magazine called &lsquo;Kulfi&rsquo; in marathi.</li>
<li>Nidhi worked on session planning</li>
<li>House huntting</li>
</ul>
<p>Sent this email to namrata di and vishal bhai :</p>
<p>આપણે વાત કરવા માટેનો સમય સેટ નથી થઇ રહ્યો એટલે મેં વિચાર્યું કે ઈમેલ જ કરું, શાંતિ થી પોતાના સમયે વાંચી શકાય</p>
<p><strong>અત્યારે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>મારુ પ્રથમ માં કામ ધીમે ધીમે ચાલી રહ્યું છે. મારે વેસ્ટ મેન્જમેન્ટ, કલામેન્ટ ચેન્જ વિષય પર વિવિધ વિડીયો માટેની સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાની હોય છે. મારો તો સ્ક્રીપ્ટ લખવાનો પહેલો અનુભવ છે એટલે મને થોડી વાર લાગે, બ્રેઈન સ્ટોર્મ કરવા જોઈએ, ક્રિએટિવ કામ છે પણ અહીં આ લોકો એકદમ ફેક્ટરી અપ્રોચ વાપરે છે એટલે મને ખુબ સ્ટ્રેસ થાય.  ટિમ આખી રીમોટ્લી કામ કરે છે, એના ફાયદા છે પણ ગેરફાયદા પણ છે. કોઈ કલ્ચર અથવા કામ સિવાય વાત નહિ.
એક વખત રેઝિગ્નેશન આપવાની કોશિશ કરી પણ ટીમ લિડે કીધું કે તારું કામ બદલી નાખીએ એટલે તને થોડી મજા આવે :) આમ કરી કરી ને ચાલે છે. કેટલીક વાર બધું અર્થ વગરનું લાગે, કોઈક વાર નવું શીખવા મળે છે, મન ઉપર કામ થઇ રહ્યું છે..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ અહીં પાછી આવી ગઈ છે. એની ફેલોશીપ નું કામ શરૂ કરશે, અમિત ભાઈ અને બીજા એક બે મિત્રો બાળકો શોધવા માં મદદ કરી રહ્યા છે. અત્યારે 3 લર્નિંગ સેન્ટર ઉપર બાળકો સાથે નેચર એજ્યુકેશન પર કામ થશે એવું ગોઠવ્યું છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>હું અહીં રામેશ્વરી બેન ની સંસ્થાના બાળકો સાથે થોડો સમય વિતાવું છું. લોકલ ખોજી કરીને &lsquo;લોકલ સિવિક પ્રોબ્લેમ સોલવિંગઃ&rsquo; ઉપર એક કોર્સ લીધો. આ ગ્રુપ આપણા 12+ ના ગ્રુપ જેવું જ છે. એમની સાથે નાના નાના પ્રોજેક્ટ કરું છું.
એ લોકો માટે ઇન્ટર્નશિપ ડિઝાઇન કરી રહ્યા છે. હું વિચારતો હતો કે બીમી ના બાળકો પણ અહીં ઇન્ટર્નશિપ કરવા માટે આવી શકે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઈમ્પના અને સાત્વિકા સાથે અઠવાડિયા માં એક વખત વાત થઇ જાય છે. પોડકાસ્ટ વાળા પ્રોજેક્ટ પાછો શરૂ કરવાનો છે. કોશિશ કરી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ઘરે શું ચાલી રહ્યું છે :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ઘણી વાર મને લાગે કે અમે વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય ખોટો લઇ લીધો. એ વખતે નિધિ ને થિન્ક ટેક માં ન ફાવ્યું, એ બીમી માં સેટ થશે કે નહિ એ મને ડાઉટ હતો, ઘરે મમ્મી ને અને પપ્પા ની તબિયત સારી નહોતી રહેતી, સગાઈ માટે પણ અમે લોકો અહીં એમની સામે હતા તે સારું રહ્યું , જો અહીં રહેવા ન આવ્યા હોત તો સગાઈ માટે અઘરું પડત. આ બધું જોતા વડોદરા આવવાનો નિર્ણય બરાબર લાગે છે. પણ બીમી ને ખુબ મિસ કરું છું હું. મને ઘણા વર્ષો પછી મારે જેવું કામ કરવું હતું એના માટેનું પ્લેટફોર્મ મળ્યું હતું, પણ હું ચાહતો હોવા છતાં કામ ન કરી શક્યો.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>નિધિ હમણાં લગ્ન ન થાય ત્યાં સુધી અલગ ઘર માં રહેવાની છે. એના ઘરે થી સાથે રહેવાની પરમિશન નથી, મારા ઘરે એવો કઈ વાંધો નથી પણ&hellip; + એનો નાના ભાઈએ 12 પછી એક વર્ષનો બ્રેક લીધો છે, એટલે એ પણ રહેવા આવવા માંગે છે એટલે એવું સેટ કર્યું છે હમણાં. ઘર શોધી રહ્યા છે.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ઘરે એક દિવસ મેં નિધિ સાથે વાસણ ઘસ્યા એમાં મમ્મી - પપ્પા ને બહુ ખરાબ લાગ્યું. એમને એવું થયું કે નિધિ મારી પાસે કામ કરાવે છે. મેં કીધું કે અમે બંને મળીને કામ કરી રહ્યા છે. પણ એ ન માન્યા, નિધિ કઈ મને ફોર્સ કરીને નહોતી બોલાવતી. બીજી રીતે પણ એ લોકો એવી એક્સપેક્ટેશન રાખે કે નિધિ જોબ ના કરે બસ ઘરનું કામ કરે.. પપ્પા ને તો  હજી આ સંબંધ ગમતો જ નથી, પૈસાની બાબતે પણ એમને એવું થાય.. નિધિ ની જોબ નહોતી ત્યારે મેં નિધિ ને મેં થોડી મદદ કરી હતી એમાં એમને વાંધો પડી ગયો.. કેમ એને પૈસા આપ્યા.. આ છોકરી બધા પૈસા પડાવી લેશે ને આવું બધું.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>મને બહુ જ ગુસ્સો આવે, પણ કોને કહું કેવી રીતે આમાં આગળ વધુ ખબર નથી પડતી, મને લાગતું હતું મમ્મી સમજશે, એ પણ આવી જ બધી વાતો કરે છે. તો હમણાં આ બધી વાતનો સ્ટ્રેસ ચાલે છે.</p>
<p>ચાલો હમણાં આટલી અપડેટ રાખીએ, પછી પાછા વધારે વાત કરીશું</p>
<p>આવજો</p>

Had a call with my team lead. Had meetings with the team for a new content development project.&#xA;I am not enjoying work at Pratham fully because of sevral reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pratham is a big org. Culture of the org feels more corporate (I worked at eklavya and BeMe. Nobody can bit that culture)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;work of developing content sometimes feels meaningless and espacially when you are working on some CSR project whcih is demanding a specific kind of content which is not alligned with your thought process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I am technically not skilled enough to develop content using AI tools. Young people in my team use AI like a pro. I sometimes run out of learning new skills and hold on to what I already know.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I mostly worked in small teams. Worked directly with the founder or team leads. where people know my skills and they value it. Give recongtion. Here I am one of hundrads. so I am feeling unreconigiesd.&#xA;not feeling part of the larger thing, not feeling belogingness. I don&amp;rsquo;t know this is good or bad but it is happening that much I know&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;also I feel that : do I really invest my energy in content development work or directly work with children but with clear vision and goals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In this week I took local khoji&amp;rsquo;s online session&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On friday my nanaji got expierd because of long time illness. Me and parents went to mama&amp;rsquo;s place&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I wrote blog post called &lt;a href=&#34;https://learningwala.in/blog/working-with-youth/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Work with Youth&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<p>Whole week went in an engagement thing. It was a complex project beyond my expectation. event management + people&rsquo;s ego management and what not..But I somehow finished it. I want to put photographs here but cropping and uploading is a little difficult when you are updating a website / blog from a local machine. I will put it on instagram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pitched nature education to one CSR through rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO but didn&rsquo;t get a positive response. The person was more inclined towards STEM and career oriented intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesterday I met Amit Arora. He runs an NGO called Paper Ball Education. We have discussed how we can collaborate on the nature education front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to see Swara&rsquo;s house. It is a beautiful house. Let&rsquo;s see if everything works out. We will rent out that space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 15th Pratham work will start. So I am looking forward for that</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<p>This week was a rollercoaster ride. Nidhi came back from pune. She didn&rsquo;t find any appropriate jobs or house.</p>
<p>Alternative schools she liked / shortlisted are looking for part time faculties or paying low salary or they are only looking for faculty who can teach academic subjects. She didn&rsquo;t want to get into the NGO sector again doing managerial roles. If I only work in an alternative school called &lsquo;Anubhti&rsquo;, it will be difficult to survive in the city.  </p>
<p>And alternative schools are only in the cities.</p>
<p>On the other side I got a call from my mother that my father&rsquo;s health is not good and it would be great if I will be there with family.</p>
<p><strong>What to do ?</strong> If someone passionately wants to work with children on a deeper level, alternative schools are the only platform I can see right now and they are not giving much salary. Waldorf schools, krishnamurti schools, democratic schools.. Another option is going to so-called progressive schools or international schools.</p>
<p>Most of the people working in alternative schools already worked in corporate for many years then they started school or started working in the schools. For them it is not their primary income source. For an educator full time doing this work with children for 10 years, there is no financial support system for them. There is no support system of like minded people whcih which most important thing for your growth and mental health.</p>
<p>Either they need to take side projects like consultancy or join the NGO / Development sector as manager roles. Even in NGOs ground workers who actually go and implement the program don&rsquo;t get much salary.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to tackle this thing is</strong>, if you have a partner who can support you. I saw in alternative schools one partner works in corporate and the other works in school.</p>
<p><strong>What about starting your own NGO or company ?</strong> The NGO world is highly dependent on CSR money or grants.</p>
<p>There are too many competitors and there are big players capturing the market. The game is who can do fund raising well. Who can show their work better. Who can scale things. Still there is hope because there are many companies, there is always the possibility to get small small projects every year. But this is a struggle every year.. if you see the larger picture, a 50 years old NGO also struggles to get funding. Instead of working with children, most of your energy goes to find funding</p>
<p><strong>Starting an educational company is the worst idea ever</strong>, a super cluttered market, very difficult to find product market fit. I have never come across company with really good product making money without taking money from CSR</p>
<p><strong>Ok let&rsquo;s come back to the point.</strong> So after a long discussion with Nidhi we have decided that we will not go to Pune.  We asked friends at  Eklavya Foundation if there is any work opportunity. But they are struggling with funding and extension problems so it will take 3 -4 months to materialize anything.</p>
<p><strong>Second option is :</strong> We will go to Vadodara so we can be with family. Now what about work ?</p>
<p>I said no anubhuti people. They are kind and sensitive enough so they understood my situation and supported me.</p>
<p>There is no established alternative school in Vadodara. There are one or two but they are very school and in their early stage. so the same problem. They will get parent volunteers so they will not need full time faculties.</p>
<p><strong>We thought let&rsquo;s start &lsquo;Nature Education&rsquo; work with children.</strong> Exprinatial - Project Based learning : That&rsquo;s what we know. We thought let&rsquo;s start working. For funding we will reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>We reached out to Akansha, Ravi bhai and Rameshwari ben for funding and many other friends to include them in our initiative as &rsquo;learning partner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also applied for a full time job at Pratham as Production Manager of Digital Content. It will be a remote job from Vadodara and once in a month I need to go to Pune. The idea behind it is, if I get it Nidhi will do full time work of Nature Education and we can have one income source in our bag if we don&rsquo;t get funding in future.</p>
<p><strong>Right now</strong> we are waiting for replies from people whom we asked for individual grants.
Also waiting from pratham people to reply about the Job.</p>
<p><strong>The good part is</strong> when I reached out to friends at Vadodara saying I am moving back to vadodara. They were super happy and welcoming. I am really looking forward to the whole thing. It is risky, we don&rsquo;t have any backup, no savings, we need to support our families, at least I don&rsquo;t have any academic qualification and all to go back.. we are at in the ocean.. let&rsquo;s see what will unfold</p>
<h4 id="one-more-good-update-is---vadodra-city-walks">One more good update is - Vadodra City Walks</h4>
<p>we have launched something called &lsquo;Vadodara City Walks&rsquo; with children from Rameshwari ben&rsquo;s NGO.
20 teenage children are exploring water - river in their own city. We had our first orientation on 12th April. We will have our first session with them on 20th April 2024. I am very very excited for this. I had a talk with Siddharth (Veditum) for the same. He is very happy to help and guide me on this journey. I am super happy and greatful. Thank you so much to Jubin for connecting us.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say about this week. During this whole week Nidhi was not around. She is in Pune to find a job herself and a house for both of us. I was feeling low, anxious, tense the whole week..&#xA;we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

we will find a home or not, whether Nidhi will find a job or not, how we will survive in this low salary.. all these questions were running in mind..</p>
<p>My sleep cycle is gone, I am sleeping at 2 - 2.30 at night and waking up by 9 - 10 am.
I have become a mobile addict, not the reels or social media but reading / browsing other stuff.
specifically I have become <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> addict.</p>
<h2 id="whats-been-happening">WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING</h2>
<h3 id="-website-development">&mdash;&gt; Website Development</h3>
<p><img src="/w14/terminal.jpg" alt="Terminal">
<img src="/w14/terminal.jpg" alt="Terminal"></p>
<p>I spent most of my time this week in developing small small features in my website.
I wanted to escape from the situation so I engaged myself in learning new things and implementing on my website.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have redesigned page called <a href="https://learningwala.in/educational-practice/">&lsquo;Educational Practice&rsquo;</a></li>
<li>updated &lsquo;about us&rsquo; text in all social media (medium, linkedin, instagram)</li>
<li>implemented &lsquo;hugo-bearcub&rsquo; theme with CSS tweak and RSS feed set up</li>
<li>I have shifted all weekly notes in blog section with &lsquo;weekly-notes&rsquo; tag</li>
<li>Custom domain set up with cloudflare SSL certificate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--linkedin2md">- Linkedin2MD</h4>
<ul>
<li>I made a copy of my linkedin profile in markdown. I tried using the npm package (<a href="https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md">https://github.com/fkztw/linkedin2md</a>) but it didn&rsquo;t work for me so I used inbuilt resume builder of linked in and downloaded PDF and converted it into markdown. I did a little bit (actually a lot time wise) manual editing and adding / copy-pasting specific data from the linkedin profile which was missing in resume builder. Now I have a complete profile on my website which I can update anytime / send it to anyone. I need to put a PDF version of the same.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--medium-posts-in-markdown">- Medium posts in markdown</h4>
<ul>
<li>Medium changed its policy for readers, that was the one of the triggers to start this website and blog. I have been using Medium for the last 11 years so I wanted to take a backup of my old posts
and put it here in this blog. I checked the medium setting and downloaded all the files but it came in html format which is no use for me directly. I need to convert it into a markdown to put it here. I found and tried one python script and one npm package. The npm package didn&rsquo;t work for me. The Python script worked but it was converting one file at a time. I have lots of files. So I am stuck.
I am searching for another tool or I will try to tweak this script to do multiple files. If anything doesn&rsquo;t work I will do it manually.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="--i-have-learnt-about">- I have learnt about</h4>
<ul>
<li>Github Workflow</li>
<li>How to use github issue as comment box on your website</li>
<li>using Prose.io as CMS</li>
<li>Fediverse</li>
<li>self hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>I will implement these all features in later on, not in priority. you can see what I am work on website <a href="http://simp.ly/p/W6Xjkf">here</a></p>
<h4 id="--custom-domain-email">- Custom domain email</h4>
<ul>
<li>Custom domain email id setup using zoho mail. I have created <a href="mailto:mihir@learningwala.in">mihir@learningwala.in</a> , I was searching for the trick so I can only forward emails written by humans to my new id from my gmail id. I didn&rsquo;t want any subscription / promotion / updates email to come on my new id. Finally I found something called &lsquo;filters&rsquo; in gmail where you can make rules for email forwarding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use gmail for / at</p>
<ul>
<li>all the places / social accounts / subscription</li>
<li>for using cloud storage G drive (mostly if my collaborator is using it otherwise i mostly use markdown and simplenote for pretty much everything and for project management I use basecamp</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted my custom domain,it is fun to see and use.  Also I wanted to shift the communication part from gmail to a new custom email id. Where only humans communicate no machine generated emails. Custom domain email on google is costly. Also they only give 30GB cloud storage and if you use a normal paid account you will get 100 gb in 1300 rs yearly.</p>
<p>so I searched for other services which give custom domain email service. Price comparison, feature comparison</p>
<p>Migadu and Fast email came multiple times in the recommendation but finally I signed up for zoho mail. They are giving free custom domain email with 5GB email space. I have tried this service before for some time with my old domain learningwala.com. So I was familiar with it. If only humans talk 5GB is space and if it exceeds the limit/ needs more features the price is 58.34rs per month.</p>
<p>Apart from gmail I was using hey.com / hey email by 37signals (makers of basecamp). It is paid service after a one month trial. But I wrote to them that I really like the service and the price point you are offering (99$ yearly) is not affordable for me. They gave me a 1 year free subscription. I really liked the product and spacilly the desktop and mobile app with clean simple UI and their workflow features. I love writing emails in those apps. But finally I have decided that I need to move on because two reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>dependence on them for the pricing. I can afford to give 8000 rupees yearly for the email service.</li>
<li>I want to try a custom domain which is more costly then normal email on hey. So finally set an auto responder on hey account saying please email me on my new email id.</li>
</ol>

<li>I have done mitaliben&rsquo;s school website domain and hosting renewal. It was difficult to do payment on wix because they only accept cards. I got new card from bank in that net banking / international purchase is not active. I tried another friend&rsquo;s card but it didn&rsquo;t work.. finally my axis bank debit card worked. The friend gave the idea that you can activate international purchases from your axis bank app. I quickly downloaded the app, and it worked.</li>

<h3 id="-call-with-rameshwariben-2nd-april-2024">&mdash;&gt; Call with Rameshwariben (2nd April 2024)</h3>

<li>I had a call with Rameshwari ben, she wants to do some activities related to nature / environment with teenage children at her NGO. I did some research and planning for it during the week.

Ankush and Sneha replied promptly, they said they can connect me with MSU environment dept and Navrachana university, Sneha will send my requirements to her friends in vadodara so they can help. I also reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhushri-mudke-7398b030/?originalSubdomain=in">Madhushree from ATREE</a>, she sent some amazon links to buy water testing kits, Ankush also sent one link for kit.</p>
<h3 id="-writing-about-tools-for-self-directed-learning">&mdash;&gt; Writing about tools for self directed learning</h3>
<p>I have started writing about tools for self-directed learning. What are the tools which can help you in doing self directed learning? I am reflecting on my journey, observation of BeMe children, Conversation with Nidhi and Nidhi Solanki</p>
<p>some of the tools I have identified :</p>
<ul>
<li>Note taking</li>
<li>how to make your portfolio (how to document, your own narrative writing, website or other medium)</li>
<li>how approach people/ communication (cold emails, networking, researching about people - org - project - anything )</li>
<li>how manage your tasks, how to work in team</li>
<li>what is the goal of internship and how to find one</li>
<li>how to prepare yourself for internship</li>
<li>list of places where children can go and work (different location, different subject)</li>
<li>list of mentors</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting resource - <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">https://www.recurse.com/self-directives</a></p>
<p>I want to write how you can learn these tools so you can implement them during your sdl journey. I will publish it after I finish writing it.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.&#xA;I was in constant stress about Nidhi&amp;rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was happening. It was an emotional roller coaster ride for me.
I was in constant stress about Nidhi&rsquo;s Job and overall decision of moving to pune. We will be able to survive or not. Choosing alternative school to work means low salary, long working hours.. Are we taking the right step? or should we leave our passion and just join a high paying opportunity ? Will we be able to find an affordable house or not..</p>
<p>On the other side communication - coordination with parents about engagement planning is going on. They are not happy that we are moving to pune without any financial security.</p>
<p>Yesterday Nidhi went to Pune for interviews and visited a few alternative schools. I am praying, hoping something will work out. Over friend Nirmala is getting enage on 12th so we are planning if we can attend the function while coming back from Pune.</p>

<p>This week I spend lots of time in making - remaking - fixing and adding content to my personal website using hugo server and github pages. I learnt that text editer is importnat part of coding process. first I used sublime text and because of that hugo server was giving some error. I shifted to ubuntu defult text editor and somehow I managed to work. From last few days ubuntu was giving some glitchs on my laptop. specificly about sound and bluetooth. Sound was not coming and bluetooth was not connecting to my boat blootooth speaker. I tried different driver and fixing stuff using ubuntu forums and other websites but no sucess. Finally I re installed ubuntu. Before that I tried using and lots of reading about Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora.. I installed Pop OS but not satisfied with it, tried Manjaro but I didn&rsquo;t like KDE. Finally I came back to ubuntu 22. During this process of making website I reserched a lot about :</p>
<ul>
<li>static site genrator like hugo, pelican and more</li>
<li>Minimal - indie web blogging platform</li>
<li>Personal wiki and note taking tool</li>
<li>linux distro like manjaro, arch linux</li>
<li>How to use dynamic page and CMS in wix.com</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhxznWkXYAAsJch?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="linux distro"></p>
<p>I know these all are rabbit holes, i spent qite a lot of time to read hackernews this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I am happy that I didn&rsquo;t spend much time on instagram or other social media.</li>
<li>I am happy that I learnt to make website using hugo and github pages.  I wanted to use hugo-bearcub theme but it is giving some error. Currently I am using hugo-bearblog theme</li>
<li>making your personal wiki using <a href="http://simplenote.com/">&lsquo;simple note&rsquo;</a></li>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg" alt="Aaron "></p>
<p>that lead me to watching <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz&rsquo;s</a>  documetry called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo;s own boy&rsquo;. Yes I know I discovered it very late but I was amazed by watching it. it is very very thought provoking. After watching documentry I spent quite a lot of time reading about open data work of <a href="https://thejeshgn.com/">thejesh GN</a> and other people. <a href="https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/">Arvind Gupta</a> is also doing wonderful work of putting educational / children litreture in public domain through his website and using internet archive.  I was feeling so happy when I got to know that Aaron contributed in making of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">&lsquo;Markdown&rsquo;</a> and I am using it right now :)</p>
